  "title": "Purpose",
  "body": "Purpose  This textbook is intended for collegiate pre-nursing students as a part of a two semester course in General, Organic, and Biological chemistry. The first ten chapters of this text is also appropriate for high school students as a first chemistry course and pairs with the Franciscan Advantage program in chemistry that is offered by Franciscan University of Steubenville.  I believe that this textbook is unique in that it pairs active-learning in chemistry with a Catholic-Christian understanding of science and chemistry. Active learning is an educational term that encompasses many different approaches, but importantly means that the student is actively engaged in learning rather than listening to lectures.  This textbook is divided into chapters. Each chapter is further divided into lessons (which are appropriate for a 50 min college class or perhaps several days worth of a high school class). Within each lesson are several sections, each of which teaches a different concept. The sections contain a text lesson, which should ideally be read by the student before class. Each section ends with several exercises which are designed to be completed during class, with the help of peers or the instructor. Studies have repeatedly shown that students learn better and retain knowledge better when they are actively engaged in learning new material rather than simply having it presented to them.  This text also aims to incorporate a Catholic-Christian understanding of science, philosophy, and ethics. The first chapter of the textbook focuses heavily on this, but there are additional places throughout the textbook where the relevance of the lesson to our faith and morals is discussed further.  To further aid in student learning, this textbook includes helpful online video instruction to accompany the various chapters and lessons in the textbook. These videos are freely available on YouTube, and teachers and students are encouraged to utilize them where they deem appropriate.  "

  "title": "Learning in an Active Classroom",
  "body": "Learning in an Active Classroom  This textbook is designed for use in an Active Learning environment. This may be different than other classes that you’re used to taking in that there is substantially less lecturing from your instructor and more emphasis on you learning by actively participating in the learning process. This requires that you listen and take notes when your instructor is teaching, just as you would in any class. Even more important, though, is that you complete all of the exercises in this text. These should be completed before you go on to the next section, since much of science builds upon prior knowledge and skills.  When completing the exercises, you should be aware of the following guidelines:   Always WRITE down your responses to each question and include any work. If you struggled with this problem, your work should include notes to help you remember how you solved the problem. Writing helps you commit your responses to memory and provides an invaluable study aid for quizzes and\/or exams.    If you are struggling with a problem, first ask your group for help. If your group cannot solve the problem, ask your instructor for help. Reaching out for help is an essential skill in an active learning environment and throughout life!    Always make sure to check your answer with the key in the textbook. Everyone makes mistakes! The only way to correct them is to know that you made a mistake in the first place.    If you get help, write down notes about the help you receive!    Do not skip or ignore any exercise problem. They are all there for a reason!    Don’t be afraid to struggle! There’s no shame in not understanding something. The real failure is if you give up.     In an active learning classroom group work is highly encouraged. Not only does it give you an opportunity to help others, but it strengthens learning by requiring you to be able to explain the concepts that you’re learning about. Also, if you are the one who is having to ask the questions, forming fraternal bonds with your classmates can help you through your struggles in a class and ensure that you always have multiple sources of help available to you. On the other hand, if you’re the one explaining a concept to a fellow group member, make sure that they understand what you are saying and be patient with them if they continue to struggle. It’s all too common to have a student respond “Oh I get it now” when they don’t fully grasp what you said. Don’t be afraid to struggle!  Group work can have pitfalls if you don’t utilize it properly. It’s the responsibility of each member of the group to contribute to the exercises, to ensure that they understand the material being covered, and to ensure that their fellow group members understand the material. If you don’t understand a concept, keep asking for help until you do. Don’t just rush through the exercises and assume that because the group got the answers right that you also understand the concept or how to solve the problem. Again, don’t be afraid to struggle!   Exercise: Learning in an active classroom     Write down the 6 guidelines to completing exercises in an active classroom. Why is each one of these guidelines important?    Introduce yourself to your group members (no need to write anything down for this one, unless you want to). Suggested information includes your name, hometown, major, hobbies, etc. You may find yourself in a different group from time-to-time. Always take time to introduce yourself to people who are new to you and to learn about them as well. If you’re completing this course on your own (ex. in a homeschool environment), make sure to find someone knowledgeable in chemistry who you can reach out to. Also you can always reach out to the author, Dr. James Vranish, by emailing him at jvranish@franciscan.edu .      "

  "title": "Relationship between the natural and the supernatural",
  "body": " Relationship between the natural and the supernatural   Summary:     What is meant by the natural and supernatural    The existence of the natural world is dependent on a supernatural cause    Christians hold the natural and supernatural to both be important     Natural and the Supernatural:   In this textbook, I’m going to be assuming that the reader acknowledges the existence of the Christian God and His Son, Jesus Christ. My discussions of faith, science, and ethics will come from the theological tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, but will have a lot in common with other Christian denominations. If there are areas in the text that seem to be at odd with your own personal beliefs, I hope the information contained in here can serve as a starting point for further discussions and debates.  Catholics acknowledge Jesus and thus can’t separate their discussions of the natural world from the supernatural (bolded text is usually indicating an important term that you SHOULD know the definition of. In this textbook, definitions and extra commentary are provided by clicking on the word). Both the natural and supernatural are components of reality and are interdependent. Catholics acknowledge the existence of God, and thus existence that is beyond nature, in other words, the supernatural. As St. Thomas Aquinas argues in his Summa Theologica , the creation of the natural world presupposes a supernatural cause; nature cannot be the first cause. He argues this at length through the “first mover” argument. In this argument he establishes that the natural world is dependent on God for its existence. This argument goes something like this:    The natural world is full of motion. Matter moves, time moves, etc.    All motion must have a prior cause.    Natural things have the potential to move, that is they have potency That potential can be realized through the action of some outside cause. Natural things also have actuality , the ability to bring forth potency (ie. natural things can cause other natural things to move). The bringing forth of potency is a change in that thing.    There must be a first actuality to bring forth all motion. That actuality can’t have potency, otherwise it would have had to be acted on by something else first. We can summarize this by saying that there must be a “first mover”.    There is a philosophical need for an actor that can actualize motion but remain unchangeable. We call this actor God. God must therefore lack potency (He doesn’t change). Instead, God is pure actuality ( Actus Purus ). He can initiate change or motion but can’t be acted upon or changed by other things.    Actus purus must initiate all motion. Therefore God must have initiate all of nature.    After having established the existence of the supernatural in addition to the natural world, many questions arise about the importance of each and the relationship between them (example: miracles). In many ways, the Catholic faith is grounded in the supernatural. God has a supernatural nature and is both the Creator and Redeemer. Humanity is dependent on Him for existence, and the hope for eternal life rests solely in Him. Because of the supremacy of God’s supernatural nature, one might argue that the best thing that each of us can do with our lives is to put all of effort into understanding the supernatural, thus minimizing the importance of the material world. Indeed portions of scripture could be interpreted as saying that this is the approach that Catholics should take. Two examples:    “Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”  1 John 2:15      “’Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?  Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?  Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?  Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.  But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.  If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?  So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’  All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.  But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.”  Matthew 6: 25-33.    So, should we all study theology and scorn the study of the natural world? Hopefully it is obvious to you that this view is incomplete and thus misguided…but why?     Summarize the first mover argument in your own words.      Answers may vary (see the argument in the text to check for similarity to what you stated).        Explain the terms potency, actuality, and Actus Purus in your own words. What is the relationship between the three terms?      Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. Potency is some change that can be realized in a thing. Actus Purus is a term for God that describes Him as pure actuality without potency. Actuality brings forth potency. The first actualization must have been from Actus Purus.        Would most superheroes be best classified as natural or supernatural? They are clearly exceptional, but are they supernatural?      They are exceptional but natural. They can be seen and touched. Their powers often work within nature (example: spiderman can only swing because of his webs).        Are angels natural or supernatural? Do angels possess potency, actuality, or both?      Angels are supernatural (example: they donâ€™t exist in one particular space; their movement defies the laws of physics). Angels can change and therefore possess potency. They can also influence other things and thus have actuality.        Is everything that is supernatural Actus Purus?      Angels are an example of something that is supernatural that nonetheless possesses potency. Only God is Actus Purus.        As Catholics, we believe that God is not exclusively supernatural. We believe that Jesus is the unity of the supernatural and the natural in one person. How does this knowledge inform the way in which we should approach the relationship between the natural and the supernatural as Catholics? Is one more important than the other?      Human nature and human bodies are a part of God, through his Son, Jesus. God is therefore body and spirit, natural and supernatural. If we are to love God, we must love both parts. In caring for others, we must care for their bodily and spiritual needs.        Catholics are called to be separate from the world, yet we are material creatures. What are ways in which we can practically abandon materialism?      When we say we should abandon materialism, we mean that we should abandon unhealthy attachments. For instance, food is good, but gluttony is sinful. We can avoid gluttony by practicing occasional fasting.       "

  "title": "The greatest commandment",
  "body": " The greatest commandment   Summary:     Love God and love your neighbor as yourself    In order to holistically love our neighbor, we must care for their natural and supernatural needs     The Greatest Commandment:   In scripture, Jesus gives us the Greatest Commandment:    “[Jesus] said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.  This is the greatest and the first commandment.  The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”  Matthew 22:37-39    Each of us lives and acts in the natural world. God gives us his commandments to help us live according to His will. The greatest commandment unites the supernatural and natural world into one rule for us. We should love God, and when we love one another, we are loving God by loving them. Humans are body (natural) and soul (supernatural). If we are to love our neighbor in a holistic way, we must show concern for their natural and supernatural needs. This is reflected in in the following passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:    “All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and love.  Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.” Catechism of the Catholic Church 1878    How do we care for the material needs of others? In many cases this is obvious. All people need food, water, and shelter. Providing access to quality healthcare is another way in which we love our neighbor through natural means. As Catholics, we should strive to ensure that our care for neighbor is not solely a material benefit, but a spiritual one as well. By incorporating empathy, compassion, friendship, and brotherly\/sisterly love into our material service to one another, we ensure that we are holistically loving our neighbor and serving their needs in the best possible way. The Catholic Church clearly shows us ways that we can care for the body and soul of our neighbor through the lists of corporal (bodily) and spiritual works of mercy.        Corporal works of mercy  Spiritual works of mercy    Feed the hungry  Counsel the doubtful    Give drink to the thirsty  Instruct the ignorant    Clothe the naked  Admonish sinners    Shelter the homeless  Comfort the afflicted    Visit the sick  Forgive offenses    Visit the imprisoned  Bear wrongs patiently    Bury the dead  Pray for the living and the dead     There are other less obvious ways in which we are also called to love our neighbor. Human beings are part of creation and exist within the environment around them. We must therefore show love to neighbor by ALSO showing respect for Creation. This is emphasized in the following quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as well as a couple of Papal encyclicals:    “The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.  Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.”  Catechism of the Catholic Church 2415      “The environment is God's gift to everyone, and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole… In nature, the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God's creative activity, which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs, material or otherwise, while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation.” Caritas in Veritate 48.      “The created things of this world are not free of ownership: ‘For they are yours, O Lord, who love the living’ (Wis 11:26). This is the basis of our conviction that, as part of the universe, called into being by one Father, all of us are linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect.” Laudato si 89.      “Moreover, when our hearts are authentically open to universal communion, this sense of fraternity excludes nothing and no one. It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty towards any creature is ‘contrary to human dignity’. We can hardly consider ourselves to be fully loving if we disregard any aspect of reality: ‘Peace, justice and the preservation of creation are three absolutely interconnected themes, which cannot be separated and treated individually without once again falling into reductionism’” Laudato si 92       The Greatest Commandment sounds like two commandments. Explain why this is not the case.      When we love one another, we love Godâ€™s creation and our neighbors. We cannot fully love God, without loving everything that comes from Him, including creation and our neighbors.        Explain what I mean when I say that we are called to holistically love our neighbor.      We are each body and spirit. In order to love our neighbor, we must show compassionate care for both their body and spirit.        Imagine that you receive healthcare in a clinic that is exceptional in healing you but is simultaneously cold and impersonal. How would you feel? Come up with concrete ideas for how you could prevent a patient from feeling this way if you were a medical professional.      I probably wouldnâ€™t be very happy. I might feel disrespected or as-if I was just a source of income for the hospital\/doctor. If a doctor takes the time to have a real conversation with a patient rather than rushing through a visit, this can help to fulfill the spiritual needs to companionship that the patient has.        Explain a concrete way in which our respect for the environment can manifest itself as love of neighbor. Similarly, explain a concrete way in which abuse of the environment can manifest itself in harming our neighbor.      Picking up garbage along a hiking trail can help the next visitor more fully enjoy the beauty of Godâ€™s creation. Throwing away toxic chemicals can lead to them entering bodies of water that people swim in or get their drinking water from. This can lead to health problems for your neighbor.       "

  "body": " What is science?   Summary:     Science is a methodology for investigating the natural world    Laws vs. hypotheses vs. theories    Scientific method    Observations lead to hypotheses which leads to experiments which leads to more observations      Science is something that everyone does, even if they don’t realize it     What is science?    Science is a methodology that allows us to learn about nature. People have been doing science since the beginning of mankind. The development of tools, hunting methods, agriculture, etc. were all dependent on knowledge gained through science. The methodology used for science wasn’t rigorously defined until 1620 when Francis Bacon published his work Novum Organum. Further refinements and definitions have led to what we now call the scientific method . This process begins with making observations about the natural world. These observations can lead to laws or hypotheses. Laws are statements about patterns invariably observed in nature (you can basically think of them as an observation with elite status). They are rules that seek to explain what will happen in a given circumstance based on what has been observed again and again, without exception. A common example of a law is the law of gravity. It can be described in different ways: “what goes up must come down”, “objects with mass attract one another”, or even with a mathematical equation ( ). Note that these descriptions predict what will happen and may even provide a quantitative prediction, but they do NOT explain why. Laws do NOT have to be formalized in textbooks, though. For instance, I’d like to point out that most of us are familiar with the “law of glowing red metal” that states that glowing red metal is quite hot and probably shouldn’t be touched.  The scientific method starts with an observation or law, but progresses further by seeking to explain why nature behaves in the way it does. A statement that seeks to explain the causes of natural phenomena that is based on observations or laws is called a hypothesis . A hypothesis is an explanation that has not been suitably tested. In order to lend support to a hypothesis, scientists often carry out experiments. A properly designed experiment tests the effect of a limited number of variables (ie. something that is changed, and therefore tested in an experiment) while striving to keep everything else as identical as possible. In a properly designed experiment, there are always a minimum of two possible groups: controls and experimental groups. The control group serves as a comparison, showing what the outcome is if the variable is ignored\/absent\/unchanged. The experimental group consists of groups where the variable is changed. By comparing the results between the controls and experimental groups, we can reach conclusions about whether the experiment supports or refutes our hypothesis. Importantly, experiments can NEVER prove a hypothesis to be correct, instead they allow us to reject alternative explanations.  When interpreting the results of experiments and trying to develop explanations for the causes of an observation, one of the principles that guides all of science is known as Ockham’s razor, which states that the simplest explanation that is consistent with known experimental results is the one that should be held. William of Ockham, the namesake of Ockham’s razor, was a Catholic Franciscan friar in the 14 th century, and made several contributions to philosophy and theology. This further highlights the relationship between science, philosophy, and theology; the very roots of scientific thought and logic are grounded in philosophical and theological principles.  Using Ockham’s razor, scientists can begin to piece together models that explain their observations. These models can lead to further hypotheses and experiments. If a hypothesis has withstood numerous experiments, it can be considered to be a theory . A theory is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested (a single experiment or test is rarely enough) and has NEVER been shown to be inconsistent with an experimental result. Experimental results that conflict with a hypothesis do NOT have to lead to outright rejection of the hypothesis and often instead lead to revision or addition of clarifications or exceptions. The distinction between a hypothesis and a theory is subjective and open to interpretation, but scientists all agree that enough experiments should have been carried out to allow obvious alternate explanations to be rejected.  An example of the scientific method in action:  A carpenter observes that wood is a strong building material that is capable of holding a large amount of weight and wants to understand why. The carpenter hypothesizes that thick wood is capable of holding more weight than thin wood. To test this, the carpenter sets up a control group consisting of wood with a standard thickness and experimental groups that have wood with other thicknesses (either thicker or thinner). He then tests each group by observing how many books each piece of wood can hold before breaking. His results show that thin boards hold less weight than thick boards. We’d say that board thickness correlates with board strength. While this result supports his hypothesis, there are still other possible explanations for the result. For instance, perhaps the process used for reducing the thickness of the boards damaged the wood by introducing cracks. Alternatively, the thin pieces of wood might have had more (or fewer) wood grains and that might instead have been the source of the observed outcomes. . Correlation does not equal causation!     Come up with 3 additional laws of nature that you have encountered in your own life that you wonâ€™t find listed in a science textbook.      The law of melting butter. When you heat butter, it turns into a liquid. The law of successful campfires. Camp fires burn best when they have adequate ventilation near the bottom. The law of autumn. Leaves turn from green to yellow, orange, or red in the fall.        Come up with 3 ways in which you used the scientific method in your own life without realizing what you were doing.      I try out different amounts of time when frying eggs to see whether the yolk is hard or runny. (experiment). I observe that when I hit the up volume button on the remote control, the TV gets louder (observation). I think that my lawn is turning brown because it needs more water (hypothesis)        Look around you right now. Observe something and write it down. Try to develop a hypothesis that explains that observation. Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. Why controls would you need? What results would you expect that would validate your hypothesis?      Light is coming through various sized slits in the blinds in my room. I think that light can always pass through any gap, no matter how small. I get two objects that can move to change the gap size between them. I place a light behind them and observe if the light can pass through at various gap sizes. A negative control would be if the objects were pressed together so no gap exists. A positive control would be the light itself without the objects to create the gap (to just make sure that I can see the light and that itâ€™s working.        Why is it important to develop alternative explanations to experimental observations?      These can remind us that scientific theories are never certain. Also, they can help us design new experiments to add greater certainty to theories (or possibly to prove them wrong).        It is seen that lead exposure levels correlate with crime rates. Does this mean that lead exposure causes crime? If not, what come up with some alternative explanations.      Not necessarily. Perhaps people who are exposed to higher levels of lead tend to be more impoverished. Perhaps that poverty is the root cause of the high crime rate.       "

  "body": " Faith, Science, Engineering, and Politics   Summary:     The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics    Science is an essential part of what makes us human    Science and faith are complementary and not at odds with one another    Faith should lead us to use science in good and just ways    What is meant by the deification of science    What are some ways in which science has built mistrust      Science, engineering, and politics are interdependent     The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics   The modern world is obsessed with science. It is easy to think of science as a modern marvel, and indeed some people have begun to deify it. The discoveries of scientists have in many cases dramatically improved life for people around the world and promise to work wonders such as the eradication of disease (even if some of these promises seem far off). Many of the observations of nature that in history appeared miraculous now have scientific explanations and theories. For instance, the variety of life of Earth is now widely believed (even amongst Catholic scientists) to have resulted from evolution rather than a single creation event (it’s worth noting, less you think of this as a source of conflict between faith and science that Catholic scientists still believe in a Creation event, but that the events that followed and their timing differ from a literal reading of Genesis). Because of this, many people have come to reject religion as superstitious nonsense, since science appears (to some) as if it might be able to explain all natural phenomena. Many modern atheists use statements like this to argue that if God is not necessary to explain anything in nature, then it doesn’t make sense to believe in the existence of God. They of course forget that science is a tool for investigating only what can be observed in nature , and therefore it’s incapable of investigating the existence God. Furthermore, as we learned about in the previous lesson, supernatural causes are a logical necessity for the existence of nature. Additionally, the scientific method depends on change for experiments to work (recall that changes are actualization of some potency). All changes must ultimately have their root in Actus Purus…something that modern atheists conveniently ignore.  On the other extreme, many people are prone to reject scientific progress for a variety of reasons. Indeed, scientific investigations and technological “advances” have created numerous problems for society, and it is understandable why people have developed a distrust of science as a result. In the 1920s, a scientist named Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered that the addition of a chemical compound containing lead into gasoline could help it burn in a more reliable way in car engines. Leaded gasoline was thus introduced and was used in the United States until 1996. Over that time, vast quantities of lead were released into the environment and resulted in a variety of toxic effect. In a different example, in the Tuskegee syphilis study, several hundred black men with syphilis in the United States had treatment unknowingly withheld from them so that scientists could study the long-term effects of the disease. Once the details of this horrendous study came to light, it understandably had a negative impact on the trust of black Americans for the American medical community   The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Volume 133, Issue 1, February 2018, Pages 407–455 .  Nowadays, there are many prominent examples of mistrust between the scientific community and various groups of people. Global warming and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are two prominent areas. In this text, I’ll neither argue for or against those issues, but instead focus on the root cause of the distrust. Some of the distrust stems from the fact that different scientific studies can sometimes arrive at different conclusions. The reasons for this are complex and varied, but so are the subjects being studied.  For instance, one study might show that chemical X causes cancer while another study doesn’t. This disagreement might be due to differences in the amounts of chemical X used in the study, the amount of time of the exposure, the use of mice vs. rabbits, the type of test used, etc. Cancer is a very complex disease, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the studies and factors that influence its occurrence are complex as well.  Similarly, in the field of climatology (the study of climate) there are studies and data that show evidence of man’s role in global warming and other data that disputes this. Can science come to meaningful conclusions then? In cases where different studies have different outcomes and conclusions, the scientific community tries to carry out more and better designed studies in an effort to arrive at a consensus , but a consensus represents the belief that the majority of the best studies support a particular theory.  The bias of researchers can also play a role in science. An ethical scientist tries to avoid bias, but it can be difficult to eliminate entirely, especially since the importance of a scientific discovery is often linked to funding. In some cases, bias can and has led to incorrect interpretations of data, outright falsification of data, and entirely incorrect conclusions. However, bias is present in pretty much every part of life, with examples ranging from restaurant preferences to political decision making. Bias shouldn’t be a reason to distrust all scientists and scientific theories, but it is important to scrutinize scientific conclusions, especially when they begin to impact our lives, the lives of others, and\/or our environment.  Another reason for distrust of science has to deal with a misunderstanding of what science is. I would argue that much of the disagreement and distrust of science in our society is not at science at all, but rather at engineering and even more so politics . Engineering and science are closely related and interdependent fields. Where science seeks answers to the causes of things, engineering seeks to use that knowledge to create solutions to problems. Politics is related to both fields since our political leaders strive (or should strive) to find the best ways to use scientific knowledge and engineering creations to further the good of society.  As an example, let’s take the example of the Covid vaccines. A combination of scientific discoveries and engineering advancements lead to the development of the first Covid vaccines. Their purpose was to combat the Covid-19 virus, which was rapidly spreading across the globe. The disease was poorly understood and was able to cause death, hence the desire for rapid vaccine development (a political decision). The development of the vaccine was extremely rapid, thanks to many advances in biochemical engineering and science. Political pressure led to the implementation of the vaccine before thorough testing by scientists and engineers had been accomplished. Vaccine mandates followed, and whether justified or not, they were undoubtedly controversial. Again, though, vaccine mandates are not science, they are political actions. Many people have argued that the vaccines were untested, ineffective, and potentially harmful and that science failed in these regards. I would argue that scientists and engineers did not fail at all, but actually performed extraordinarily well. The scientific method takes considerable time and in the case of the Covid vaccine, due to political decisions, much of the discoveries of scientists lagged behind the roll out of the vaccines and their mandatory implementation. Indeed, scientists can’t test the effectiveness and safety of something that hasn’t been created yet. The decision to roll out the vaccines before the typical years worth of testing were complete wasn’t a decision of scientists but one of politicians. Many scientists definitely contributed to those political decisions, but it’s important to realize that they weren’t acting as scientists but as activists in those instances. Activists can act in ethical or unethical ways, and the same goes for scientists (and I’ll leave it to the reader to form their own opinions in this case). I’d even argue that activism is a necessity among scientists; if scientists can’t advocate for the importance of their research, then it won’t get the funding or support that is needed to carry it out (in many ways this is like a small business owner advertising a new product…but I digress…). Now, years after the vaccine rollout, biologists have largely reached a consensus about the effectiveness and safety of the Covid-19 vaccines. The majority of scientific research supports the conclusion that the initial vaccines weren’t very effective at preventing the spread of the disease, though they were effective in lessening its severity. Additionally, statistical analysis revealed that there are a variety of safety issues that correlated with the initial vaccines, though their rate of occurrence was quite low. The scientific method didn’t fail us, but it took time to carry out the studies and arrive at conclusions. Unfortunately, and perhaps unavoidably, the lines between science, engineering, and politics are often blurred and this can regrettably result in distrust in science and scientists for reasons that aren’t science at all.  When science and technology are deified, great error can result. On the other hand, lack of trust in scientists and their conclusions can lead to distrust and animosity and can potentially lead to the rejection of engineering advances that can help mankind. What then is the proper attitude to take towards science and its relationship to faith and human flouring? Read the following text from the Church’s Pastoral Constitution, Gaudium et Spes :  “Christians, on pilgrimage toward the heavenly city, should seek and think of these things which are above. This duty in no way decreases, rather it increases, the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the building of a more human world. Indeed, the mystery of the Christian faith furnishes them with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this duty more courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity, one which gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man.  When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of technology, in order that it might bear fruit and become a dwelling worthy of the whole human family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social groups, he carries out the design of God manifested at the beginning of time, that he should subdue the earth, perfect creation and develop himself. At the same time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself at the service of his brethren.  Furthermore, when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy, history and of mathematical and natural science, and when he cultivates the arts, he can do very much to elevate the human family to a more sublime understanding of truth, goodness, and beauty, and to the formation of considered opinions which have universal value. Thus mankind may be more clearly enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which was with God from all eternity, composing all things with him, rejoicing in the earth, delighting in the sons of men.  In this way, the human spirit, being less subjected to material things, can be more easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator. Moreover, by the impulse of grace, he is disposed to acknowledge the Word of God, Who before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was already \"in the world\" as \"the true light which enlightens every man\" (John 1:9-10).  Indeed today's progress in science and technology can foster a certain exclusive emphasis on observable data, and an agnosticism about everything else. For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth. By virtue of their methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things. Indeed the danger is present that man, confiding too much in the discoveries of today, may think that he is sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher things.  Those unfortunate results, however, do not necessarily follow from the culture of today, nor should they lead us into the temptation of not acknowledging its positive values. Among these values are included: scientific study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries, the necessity of working together with others in technical groups, a sense of international solidarity, a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even to protect men, the desire to make the conditions of life more favorable for all, especially for those who are poor in culture or who are deprived of the opportunity to exercise responsibility. All of these provide some preparation for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which can be animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world.”  Pure science is a tool that humanity can use to gain knowledge of God’s creation. Knowledge of creation sheds light on its Creator and is therefore a commendable exercise for a Christian to undertake. Unfortunately, human history is filled with examples of the knowledge of science being misused for sinful purposes. The use of knowledge is distinct from the knowledge itself, often involving other human enterprises such as medicine, business, politics, etc. Science itself is not free from sin either. When scientists place the pursuit of knowledge above the laws of God, unethical experimentation can result.     I'd argue that science is an essential part of what makes us human. Do you agree or disagree? Why?      Humans are created to know and wonder. Science is the way in which we can do this in the natural world        The text above describes two very different ways in which science is misunderstood in society. Explain these two ways in your own words.      Science can be misunderstood to be the â€œanswer to our prayersâ€. Science can also be distrusted because of how it is utilized for engineering and political purposes. Scientific investigations can also be carried out in unethical ways.        How are engineering, science, and politics related?      Politics tries to encourage human flourishing. It needs solutions to problems, which is the purpose of engineering. Engineering relies on knowledge from science in order to design good solutions to problems.        One of the footnotes above says that scientists can be activists in ethical ways or unethical ways. Do you agree? What requirements would you have for a scientist to behave as an ethical activist?      An ethical activist\/scientist should not state their theories as scientific fact. They should also present the best synopsis of the available knowledge (and alternative explanations).        How can science aid faith? How can faith aid science?      Science can remove superstition from faith and correct errors in our knowledge. Faith can allow science to pursue worthwhile knowledge in ethical ways.        Science can lead to knowledge about the natural world. How is that knowledge connected to our love of God? (Think back to the last lesson)      Knowledge of nature is knowledge of Godâ€™s Creation and thus provides insight into God Himself. It can also provide us the knowledge to better care for our neighbors. In the last lesson we learned that love of neighbor is inseparable from love of God.        What are some ethical science problems that you foresee yourself having to contend with in your profession? How might you deal with this?      Answers may vary        Academic pursuits (such as you are now undertaking) are full of ethical struggles as you strive to acquire knowledge and progress toward your vocation. In many ways this is similar to the ethical dilemmas encountered by scientists. Come up with 3 ways in which a student might be tempted to sin as they pursue knowledge and advancement.      Answers may vary        Christ has conquered sin and has redeemed the world. Use this fact to compose a short prayer that you can use is difficult ethical moments throughout your academic and professional career.      Answers may vary       "

Section 3: Chemistry   Modern science is separated into the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. There is considerable overlap between these subjects since each discipline can influence the others. Chemistry is the study of the properties of matter . Matter can be defined as anything that occupies space and has mass . Basically, everything that you can see and touch is matter. Even particles that are too small to be seen, such as atoms and molecules, are still matter because they occupy space and have mass. Energy (defined in a later chapter), on the other hand, is NOT matter. It is a property that matter can have, but it is not a thing that occupies space. Light and heat are things that we can experience in the physical world, but they lack mass and thus are not matter. Sound is another example of energy. Sound is caused by the vibration of matter, but it refers to the vibration, not to the particles that are vibrating.  Chemistry is often referred to as the central science. This is because to fully understand the behavior and properties of matter, we first have to understand the laws of physics. Physics provides chemistry with information about the composition of matter and its most basic parts. It also provides chemists with an understanding of energy and how it interacts with matter. At the same time, all organisms are comprised of matter; thus, if we want to understand life, we need to understand the matter that comprises it. Chemistry aids biology by helping us understand how organisms function and can also help us learn how to manipulate biology, for instance by designing pharmaceuticals or pesticides.

In chemistry, they have many uses as we’ll see if upcoming chapters and exercises. The most common math that we do with fractions in chemistry is multiplying and dividing them. To carry out multiplication of fractions, we simply multiply together all of the values in the numerator The numerator is the top of a fraction, keeping the product in the numerator of the final answer, and then do a similar operation with the denominator   Multiplication of fractions example 1:     Multiplication of fractions example 2:     Dividing fractions is similarly quite easy to do. In a division problem, the first number is the dividend and the second is the divisor . Division of fractions can be expressed in multiple ways     Please note that the dividend is the numerator in the fraction expression and the divisor becomes the denominator. To complete this division problem, we simply need to flip the divisor and multiply that value by the dividend.      Section 2: Canceling out factors and labels in calculations   Another VERY important lesson to remember about fractions is that if the numerator and denominator both contain the same factor, then they cancel out. This is true for both numbers in the fractions but also for labels like units. See the examples below:  Example 1: (the 3s cancel out)   Example 2: (the “miles” labels cancel out)      Exercises:    Fraction math. Do the following math problem without using a calculator           Multiply 7 times 4 and put that on top. Then multiply 3 times 3 and put that on the bottom.                 Multiply the numbers in the numerator and put that value into the numerator of the final answer. Multiply the numbers in the denominator and put that value into the denominator of the final answer.  See if you can simplify your answer by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.                 Flip the second fraction, then multiply the two fractions.                              Dividing by 9 is the same as multiplying by             Simplify the following expression without using a calculator.          Look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and cancel them out before multiplying the fractions.                 Flip the 2nd fraction. Then look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and cancel them out. Finally, multiply the fractions.                              Treat the units like numbers. If the same unit occurs in the numerator and denominator, cancel them out.           "

We have a couple of strategies that make this much more palatable for us. One such strategy is to have different units of measurement for discussing large numbers vs. small numbers. The other common approach is to use scientific notation. Ultimately scientific notation is required, even if we use different units, because we still need to use very large (or small) numbers to express the relationship between these different units. For example, if we are talking about the distance across an atom, a common unit of measurement is an Angstrom. A hydrogen atom has a diameter of approximately 1.1 Angstroms. But how many inches is that? In order to convert between units of Angstroms and inches we'd have to know that 1 Angstrom = 0.00000000394 inches. Working with that number is obviously obnoxious, requiring us to count exactly how many zeroes there are. To get around this, we like to use scientific notation.   a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base   To write a number in scientific notation, we combine a coefficient The coefficient is the leading part of scientific notation. It should always be a number between 1 and 10 and should be written as a decimal. with a base The base follows the coefficient in scientific notation. It is multiplied by the base. It is always 10 raised to some integer power. . The coefficient is always a number that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and is written as a decimal. The coefficient is then multiplied by the base which is 10 raised to some power.    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    A positive power makes the coefficient larger by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the right by the number of digit places given by the number in the power. Conversely, a negative power makes the coefficient smaller by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the left by the number of digit places given by the number in the power.  We also have to be able to take a number that is written in standard notation and rewrite it in scientific notation. To do this, we move the decimal point in the direction that will result in a coefficient that has a value between 1 and 10. We count the number of digit places that we moved the decimal and that becomes the value in the power. If we moved the decimal to the left, then the power remains positive. If the decimal had to be moved to the right, then the value in the power becomes negative.     a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    One of the things that often confuses students about scientific notation is remembering when to move the decimal to the right or the left. These rules can be summed up by remembering the simple rule that big numbers have positive powers and small numbers have negative powers. Remembering this rule can help you determine for yourself whether you should move the decimal right or left.   Exercise 3: Scientific notation     Do the following math problems       Write the following numbers in scientific notation.    3,001.002    5,000,005    10,055,057,001    0.000 057 8    0.08    0.000 000 007 044      Write the following numbers in standard notation.                                      Do the following math problems using your calculator. You probably have a SCI and DEC button or mode on your calculator. If you need help figuring out how to do these on your calculator, please reach out to your instructor or find an online tutorial that is specific to your calculator model.    Write the following numbers in scientific notation.    3,001.002    5,000,005    10,055,057,001    0.000 0578    0.08    0.000 000 007 044      Write the following numbers in standard notation.                                       Section 4: Scientific notation and calculators   Doing multi-step calculations often leads to errors. These errors often result from incorrect calculator usage. It is important to make sure that you are correctly inputting scientific notation into your calculator. Often the correct way to do this is using the EE button on your calculator. If, on the other hand, you input scientific notation using the times button and then your exponent button, you may inadvertently input the incorrect math problem. See the example below:     4.1 EE 3 “divided by” 3.3 EE 10 =   4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 “divided by” 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10  This incorrect input above is actually calculating the following:   Another way that you can correctly input scientific notation is to put parentheses around each of your scientific notation inputs. This allows you to input the scientific notation using whichever method you’d prefer.  ( 4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 ) “divided by” ( 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10)  Another important calculator rule to remember is that when we write complex fractions, all of the operations in the numerator and denominator respectively are carried out before the division step. This is correctly input into a calculator by remembering to put parentheses around both the numerator and denominator. See the example below:     ( 7 “plus” 3 ) “divided by” ( 5.5 EE 3 “plus” 100 ) =    Exercise 4: Scientific notation and calculators .     Complete the following problems using your calculator.

We use algebra to rearrange mathematical expressions to solve for some unknown. There are two things to remember when doing algebraic rearrangements. First, our goal is to isolate the variable of interest, remembering that it must be in the numerator if we’re dealing with fractions. Second, the way in which we will isolate the variable is by carrying out . See the examples below:   Exercise 5: Algebra review.     For the following problems, solve for the value of c. In some cases your solution will be an expression rather than a number. Write out all of your steps                               Exercise 5:        3\/2    275\/9         8    20 hr    "

The numbers that we use in our calculations often describe measurements or numbers of things, such as numbers of molecules. This then raises an important consideration for us, namely how precisely do we know the numbers in our calculations? For instance, if I’m measuring the length of a piece of string, do I know its length precisely to the nearest inch, or to the nearest millimeter, or to the nearest nanometer? The answer to that question depends on the tools that were used to make the measurement and their level of precision. Obviously, you won’t be able to tell how many nanometers long a piece of string is by using a typical ruler; another much more expensive measuring device would likely be required.  To understand how precisely we know a quantity, we will first discuss the difference between exact  An exact number is one that is countable, a definition, or a desired quantity. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures. and measured  A measured number is a number that exists because of some measurement. Measured numbers have a finite number of significant figures. numbers. Exact numbers are discrete things that can be counted (ex. 3 eggs), quantities that are exact definitions (ex. there are 12 inches in one foot), or desired values (ex. the established dosage for a pharmaceutical is 10 mg\/kg\/day). Measured numbers are any quantity that had to be measured. They are also found when we are equating units that occur in different systems of measurement (ex. 2.54 cm=1 inch; 1 inch is very close to 2.54 cm, but an inch is not defined as being exactly 2.54 cm).  Exact numbers are known to an infinite level of precision. If you have 3 eggs, you don’t have 3.0000001 eggs…you have exactly 3.00000000… (keeps on going…) eggs. If the dosage of drug that you are supposed to give to a patient is 10mg\/kg\/day, the desired dose is not higher or lower than that…it is exactly that value. Measured numbers, on the other hand, are known only to a certain level of precision. A race may have taken exactly 9.813453223 (feel free to add other random digits on the end) seconds, but if I am using a stop watch that only measures hundredths of a second, then my measured value would be 9.81 seconds. Because of this, measured numbers always have a certain amount of uncertainty associated with them. How then do we communicate the level of certainty with which we know a number?  This brings us to the concept of significant figures  Significant figures are those digits in a number that convey information about its value and its precision. . Significant figures are those digits in a number that reveal the level of precision. We have to worry about the number of significant figures when we’re dealing with measured numbers, since those values are only known to a certain degree of precision. If a stopwatch at the end of a race reads 9.81 seconds, then that measurement has 3 significant figures (the 9, 8, and 1 are each significant). In that case, the time was measured to the hundredths place, but not to the thousandths place and the reported value should reflect that. Exact numbers, on the other hand, have an infinite number of significant figures because of their infinite precision.  In a measured numbers, there are some simple rules to remember in order to identify which digits are significant. First of all, non-zero digits are always significant when the number is written in standard notation (more on scientific notation in just a little bit). The complication comes from zeros in measured numbers.  There are three rules to remember with zeros:    When zeros are to the far left of the number, they are never significant    Zeros in between non-zero digits are always significant    Zeros to the far right of a number are significant ONLY if there is a decimal point written in the number.     Some examples of this:     0.0034 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 1)    3001 (the zeros are significant because of rule 2)    400.0 (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)    300 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)    300. (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3; notice the decimal has been purposely included)    The last rule for significant figures has to deal with scientific notation. In scientific notation, the power and the base are NOT significant. The only significant figures come from the coefficient portion, and it obeys the rules covered previously, including the rules about zeros. So has 5 significant figures (4.0010; the 10 to the 10 th power is not significant). Sometimes we HAVE to write a number in scientific notation to convey the correct number of significant figures. For instance, if you measured as distance of 300 cm to 2 significant figures, you can’t indicate that by writing 300 cm (1 significant figure) or 300. cm (2 significant figures). You can show it by writing cm.   Exercise 1: Significant figures     Complete the following problems      Determine if the following numbers are exact or measured.    12 cows    4.73 feet    42 minutes    23 dozen eggs    10 mm in a centimeter    12 inches in a foot    1.057 quarts in a liter      How many significant figures are in the following numbers?    4.33    17.04    0.0053020    500    1000000.    5.620 x 10 23       Rewrite the following numbers with the indicated number of significant figures.    9.9800 (4 significant figures)    2.80 x 10 4 (4 significant figures)    52000 (3 significant figures)      "

An example would be a clock with hand and markings for the hours and minutes. devices like a ruler or a graduated cylinder, the process for determining the number of significant figures in your measurement is more complicated than with a digital  A digital device is one that displays a measurement using digits only. device. With a digital device, you simply record all of the displayed numbers in your measured number and obey the rules that were learned previously for significant figures in order to determine which digits are significant . For example if a balance reads 0.320 grams, then your measurement is 0.320 grams with 3 significant figures (the left zero is NOT significant because of the rules you learned in the last section).  When we use an analog device, we frequently see that the line that we’re measuring occurs between values on the measuring scale. When reporting these measurements, we report all of the digits that are provided by the measuring scale PLUS we estimate the value of one extra digit by mentally subdividing the scale into 10 equal portions. See the example below:    A graph with a red arrow Description automatically generated   If we’re trying to measure the length of the orange arrow the scale provided depicts tenths of a unit (let’s say it’s centimeters). The orange arrow appears to be between 0.9 and 1 cm long. Since this is an analog scale, we should ALWAYS estimate one extra significant digit, even if that digit is a 0. In this case, my estimate would be 0.94 cm, but yours might differ slightly (though it should be 0.9 something).    A line with numbers and a line with a line AI-generated content may be incorrect.   In this case not all of the digits in the tenths place are shown, only 0.5. Because of this we don’t estimate an extra decimal place. Instead we estimate for the decimal place shown by the most precise markings, in this case the tenths place. My estimate would be 0.9 cm. Your estimate might be 0.8 cm or even 1.0 cm.

Radiation is the emission of energy from an object in the form of electromagnetic radiation (which we covered previously) or in the form of parts of atoms. Importantly, radiation doesn’t imply a specific cause for the energy emission. Radioactivity produces radiation, but from a very specific source. In radioactivity, an atom has an unstable nucleus, and that nucleus becomes stable, and in the process releases radiation. There are other sources of radiation other than radioactivity. Radioactivity will always produce radiation.  Now that we’ve clarified those two terms, let’s begin to learn about radioactivity in more detail. In the last chapter, we learned about isotopes. To review, isotopes are atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons and thus different mass numbers. Some isotopes of atoms are stable, whereas other isotopes have unstable nuclei. These nuclei can stabilize themselves by emitting energy or particles. This is called radioactive decay. Radioactive decay causes that isotope to emit radiation. The radiation that is emitted can be different for different isotopes. forms that we’ll be learning about, because of their relevance to medicine are gamma radiation, beta particles, alpha particles, neutrons, protons, and positrons.  What are these different forms of radiation. We’ve previously learned about gamma rays. Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation or light energy. Out of the different forms of electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays have the highest energies. The other forms of radiation that we’re going to cover are particles. It’s often helpful to group the particles together based on their similarities and differences.  Some radioactive isotopes emit gamma radiation . This emission is in the form of a photon (or light) that has energy of a gamma ray. The emission of a gamma ray is caused by an unstable nucleus relaxing to a lower energy state and emitting the lost energy as light. Unlike the other types of radioactive emission, gamma rays are massless and lack charge.  Other types of radioactive isotopes decay and emit particles. These types of particles are alpha particles, beta particles, positrons, protons, and neutrons. These particles vary in their mass and charge. Alpha particles have the greatest mass. They are essentially a helium atom nucleus. They consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons that are fused together into the largest of the particles that we’ll discuss. Beta particles are essentially electrons that are ejected from an atoms as a part of radioactive emission. However, they are ejected from the nucleus rather than from the cloud of electrons around the atom (we’ll discuss how this works more in the next section). Positrons are antimatter particles. They have the same mass as an electron, but they’re positively charged. When antimatter positrons collide with electrons, they annihilate one another and their mass is turned into energy in the form of gamma rays. We’ve already discussed protons and neutrons. Their masses and charges are the same that we’ve previously discussed, even when they are ejected from an atom as a part of radioactive decay.   Exercise 1:     Do the following particles have mass? If they do, round their mass to the nearest amu.    Gamma ray    Beta-particle    Proton    Alpha particle    Neutron    Positron      What is the charge of the following particles?    Gamma ray    Beta-particle    Proton    Alpha particle    Neutron    Positron      How many protons and neutrons are in the following nuclei?    Cobalt-57    Uranium-238    Fluorine-18       Balancing decay reactions   When radioactive decay occurs, changes happen to the radioactive atom. In most cases, the emission of the radiation results in a change in the nucleus of the atom and can even change one element into another element. To describe the changes that take place after radioactive decay, we can write a radioactive decay equation. The guiding principle when writing a radioactive decay equation is that the total mass and total charge cannot change after the decay has occurred.  The first type of decay equation that we’ll explore is gamma decay. Unlike other forms of radioactivity, there is no change in the composition of the nucleus. Instead the nucleus simply changes from a high energy state (called a metastable state) to a low energy state. This makes balancing nuclear decay equations that involve gamma emission very easy. See the example below:     In this equation, the superscript m indicates that the nucleus of iodine-125 is metastable (semi-stable\/unstable). The Greek letter gamma is used to represent the emitted gamma ray.  Two other types of radioactivity (which are quite similar) are beta particles and positrons. Beta particles and positrons are both particles that are emitted from the nucleus. Both of them have mass (although it is very small and often rounded to 0 amu, similar to an electron). Also, both beta particles and positrons have charge; beta particles are negatively charged while positrons are positively charged. When nuclei emit a particle that has charge, the remaining charge in the nucleus has to change; the charge that is emitted has to come from somewhere (it isn’t simply created). This results in the nucleus having the same mass, but a different number of protons. When the number of protons changes, the identity of the atom actually changes from one element to another. See the examples below:              Equation 1 represents a beta-particle emission. The symbol represents the beta-particle and implies that it has 0 mass and an atomic number (or charge, since we’re focusing solely on the nucleus) of -1. Sometimes beta-particles are represented in other ways, such as or , but they mean the exact same thing. Equation 2 represents a positron emission with the representing the positron (other times it may be represented by or ). Note that in both cases, the identity of the isotope changes after the particle is emitted. This is because nuclear decay equations must balance both charge and mass on both sides of the equation. Since beta-particles and positrons lack mass, the mass number of the resulting isotope remains the same as it was in the beginning (in equation 1 the mass is 3 before and after emission; in equation 2, the mass is 18 before and after emission). Now let’s talk about how we figure out the atomic number of the resulting isotope. First, recall that the atomic number of an atom is ALWAYS the number of protons in the nucleus. Since protons are positively charged, the atomic number also ALWAYS gives us the charge of the nucleus of an atom. So, in equation 1, the nucleus of hydrogen began with a charge of +1. Since a beta particle was emitted, and since it has a charge of -1 then the resulting nucleus must have a charge of +2 (because +2 +(-1)= +1). We can figure this out by making a simple equation that states that the charge on the left equals the charge on the right:     We can do the same for positron emission in equation 2:     Once we know the atomic number of the resulting isotope (2 or 8 respectively in the examples above), then we can figure out which element they represent (He and O respectively).  So how do positron and beta-particle emissions work? How is the number of protons changing? When a beta-particle is emitted, a neutron is actually changing into a beta-particle plus a proton. The negative charge of the beta particle balances out the positive charge of the proton, hence why they both come from a neutral particle. So every time a beta-particle is emitted the mass remains the same (because protons and neutrons have masses of 1 amu), but the number of protons increases by one and the number of neutrons decreases by one. When a positron is emitted, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron. Thus a proton is lost, and the atomic number decreases by one, but a new neutron appears to preserve the mass.  Another type of radioactivity is an alpha particle. Alpha particles have mass and charge, specifically a mass of 4 amu and a charge of +2. They are therefore the same as a helium nucleus. When we are balancing a nuclear decay equation involving alpha particle emission, we need to make sure to balance both mass and charge. See the example below:         Note that the mass numbers are balanced on both sides of the reaction arrow as are the atomic numbers (or nuclear charge). The alpha particle is denoted in equation 3.  Finally, radioactive decay can result in the ejection of protons or neutrons from the nucleus. When a proton decay occurs a particle is ejected. When neutron decay occurs the ejected particle is . The rules for writing the decay equations for other types of particles still applies in these cases. We simply need to ensure that the total nuclear charge is the same on both sides of the equation AND that the mass is the same on both sides of the equation as well.   Exercise 2:      Write a balanced nuclear decay equation for the following:      The beta decay of carbon-14      The alpha decay of radon-220      The gamma decay of cobalt-60      The positron emission of magnesium-23      The neutron emission of krypton-87      The proton emission of cobalt-47        What type of radiation is emitted in the following processes:      The conversion of metastable Tc-99 to stable Tc-99      The conversion of carbon-11 to boron-11      Polonium-210 changing to lead-206                       What type(s) of radioactive emission…      involves particles with non-negligible masses      produces a positively charge particle      causes the nucleus to increase in atomic number by 1      causes the nucleus to decrease in atomic number by 1      increases the number of neutrons in the nucleus      decreases the number of neutrons in the nucleus      causes no change in the identity of the element        Section 3: Uses of radioactive materials   Radioactive materials have numerous uses in energy production, science, and medicine. We’ll cover a few as a part of this section.  Nuclear power plants rely on isotopes that undergo neutron decay to initiate a process called nuclear fission . Nuclear fission is a different type of nuclear decay in which a nucleus splits. This splitting is caused by the impact of a high energy neutron (which is produced by neutron decay) on a nucleus. The impact results in an unstable nucleus that undergoes nuclear fission. When a nucleus splits, smaller nuclei are produced along with other neutrons. These neutrons can impact the nuclei of other atoms causing them to undergo nuclear fission. This leads to a chain reaction where the splitting of one nucleus leads to particles that can cause the splitting of other nuclei. Every time a nucleus undergoes fission, some of the mass of the nucleus is turned into energy. This energy can be used to heat water to a boil and the resulting steam can be used to turn a turbine and produce electricity.  Nuclear power can produce vast amounts of power without the production of greenhouse gases. However, nuclear power generates a large amount of radioactive waste. The nuclei that are produced after fission are often radioactive themselves. This presents a challenge for us to figure out ways to safely store these waste products. In addition, the radioactive materials that are needed to cause the chain reactions (namely uranium-235) are a limited resource that requires a lot of effort to mine and purify.  Radioactive isotopes are used in medicine as tracers or as therapeutics. Tracers are chemicals that can help doctors pinpoint the location of problems. In a PET scan, for instance, a patient is treated with isotopes that emit positrons. When positrons are emitted in the human body, they are quickly annihilated by the electrons in the surrounding tissues. This annihilation produces gamma rays that can be detected by specialized cameras. This allows doctors to detect the location of the positron emitting isotopes in the human body. For example, PET scans can be used to detect tumors. In this usage, the patient is fed radioactive sugar. Cancer cells take up sugar much more quickly than most tissues in the human body. As a result the radioactive isotopes accumulate in the tumor and begin emitting more positrons there. By detecting the resulting gamma rays, doctors can easily detect the precise location of a tumor.  Another medical use of radioactive materials is in radiation therapy. In radiation therapy, radioactive materials are placed in or near a tumor. Radiation can impact the tumor, leading to destruction of the molecules in those cells and ultimately the death of those cells. Unfortunately the damage is hard to confine to the tumor, and often surrounding tissues are damaged in the process, resulting in side effects.   Exercise 3:      Explain how a chain reaction is used to produce nuclear power.      Why are gamma ray cameras used to detect positrons in a PET scan?      How do doctors get cancer cells to accumulate radioactive materials prior to a PET scan?      Which type of radiation do you think would be more damaging to tissues, an alpha particle or a beta-particle? Why?         Key   Exercise 1    Do the following particles have mass? If they do, round their mass to the nearest amu.    No    Yes, 0 amu    Yes, 1 amu    Yes, 4 amu    Yes, 1 amu    Yes, 0 amu      What is the charge of the following particles?    0    -1    +1    +2    0    +1      How many protons and neutrons are in the following nuclei?    27 protons 30 neutrons    92 protons 146 neutrons    9 protons 9 neutrons      Exercise 2:                                        Gamma    Positron    Alpha    Beta    Proton    neutron        Alpha, proton, neutron    Positron, proton, and alpha    Beta    Positron, proton    Positron    Beta, neutron, and alpha    Gamma and neutron      Exercise 3:     A neutron impacts a nucleus of one atom, leading to nuclear fission and energy release. This fission releases more neutrons. These neutrons can impact other nuclei causing them to similarly undergo fission and release energy      Positrons annihilate when they encounter electrons in the atoms surrounding the positron emitters. This annihilation releases energy in the form of gamma rays      Radioactive sugar is given to the patient. Cancer cells take up and use sugar quicker than other types of tissues because they are actively growing.      Alpha particles have a greater impact because of their larger charge.     "

Radioactivity has the potential to cause chemical changes to our cells which can lead to cell death, mutations, and cancer. One of the easiest ways to minimize our risk is to use the lowest amount of radioactive isotope possible. The question then arises…how do we measure radioactivity. Radioactivity can be measured by a variety of devices, depending on the type of emission. In all cases, the SI unit that is used to measure radioactivity is a becquerel (abbreviated Bq), which is the same as one radioactive decay (or disintegration) every second. The nuclei of a radioactive isotope will randomly decay, releasing radioactivity. If a sample contains more nuclei or is more enriched in radioactive nuclei (ie. there are more radioactive nuclei and fewer non-radioactive nuclei) then the sample will produce more radiation every second, leading to a higher Bq value. Another historically important unit of measure for radioactivity is a Curie (abbreviated Ci). A Curie is a much larger quantity than a becquerel and represents 3.7 x10 10 decays per second or that same number of becquerels. A Curie often represents a very large amount of radiation, so it’s common for laboratory personnel to use smaller metric prefixes along with Curies, such as mCi or µCi.  The units of Curies and becquerels are used to describe how much radiation an object emits. The emission of radioactivity from an object moves in all directions, and thus a large percentage of that radiation may never enter the body of a patient or medical professional. To describe the amount of radiation that actually enters the body, scientists use a different unit called a rad . This unit has since been replaced by the SI unit of grey ( abbreviated Gy; one Gy is the same as 100 rad).  To quantify the damaging effects of absorbed radiation, scientists use the unit rem (radiation equivalent in man). Rem can be easily calculated from rad by multiplying it by a damage factor that is specific to the type of radioactive particle that’s being absorbed. In general, gamma rays, beta particles, and positrons cause the least amount of damage (and thus have a factor of 1), protons and neutrons cause moderate damage (and have a factor of 10), and alpha particles cause the most damage (and have a factor of 20). Another unit that is used to measure the effect of absorbed radiation is a Sievert (abbreviated Sv) . One Sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. How much radiation is too much? An average person receives about 3 mSv of radiation per year. A single x-ray or a CT scan subject a person to 0.1-10 mSv of radiation. At a dose of 50 mSv, there is a statistically detectable increase in a person’s cancer risk. Radiation sickness can begin to set in with doses of 0.5 Sv (notice the change from mSv with the previous doses). A dose of 3-4 Sv is generally fatal to ~50% of people who receive that high of a dose.   Exercise 1:     Convert 18 Ci to Bq    Convert 5.3 x 10 8 Bq to mCi.    Which sample is more radioactive, one with 4.3 µCi or one with 5.77 x 10 5 Bq?    Describe the difference between rad, Bq, and rem in terms of what they are measuring.    If a patient receives a dose of 54.3 rad of alpha particles…    How many Gy did they receive?    What is the biological impact of the radiation in units of rem?    What is the biological impact of the radiation in units of Sv?    Would you expect the person who received the dose in c to survive or be sick?    Recalculate b and c if the radiation was beta-particles instead.       Radiation safety   Radiation can pose safety risks to humans, but if users are careful, the health impacts can be minimized. In order to avoid harm from radiation, there are 3 things to consider:    Amount of radiation used    Time    Distance    Shielding    Whenever radioactive materials or other radiation sources are used, we should be careful to use the least amount possible. As you’d expect, by using lower amounts of radioactive materials, we can lessen the total exposure to radiation as well as the total amount of possible damage.  Likewise, biological damage from radiation can be lessened by spending the minimal amount of time in an environment with a radiation source. In general, the more time a person spends near a radiation source, the greater their exposure to radiation and therefore the greater the amount of biological damage that will occur.  Another important consideration is the distance between the radioactive material (or radiation source) and the person being exposed. There is a mathematical relationship between the amount of radiation a person’s body absorbs and the distance from the radiation source. The intensity of radiation decreases by the square of the distance increase from the radiation source. If you are standing 2 m from a radiation source, you would receive ¼ the radiation exposure that you would receive if you were standing 1 m away. This is because the same amount of radiation becomes spread over a larger area as the distance increases. The impact of distance on radiation intensity is described by the inverse square law equation:     Where and are the radiation intensities at the first ( ) and second ( ) distances respectively.  Finally, various forms of radiation can be blocked by different types of shielding. In general, the larger the particle and more charged it is, the less shielding required. Alpha particles, the most massive radioactive particles, can be blocked by a sheet of paper or by our outer layer of skin. For alpha particle emitters to cause biological damage, they must typically be ingested or incorporated into the body by some other means. Beta-particles can be shielded by about a centimeter of aluminum, plastic, or plexiglass. Neutrons (no charge) and gamma rays (no mass or charge) are much more difficult to shield. Radioactive sources that emit these forms of radiation often require lead or concrete shielding to block exposure.   Exercise 2:     List the 4 ways that we can help lessen our exposure to radiation when working with radioactive materials    What type of radiation is the easiest to block with shielding? Which types are the hardest to block?    Think about what you know about the mass and charge of each of the types of radiation. How does that information relate to how easy it is to block that type of radiation?    A person would be exposed to 4.0 mGy of radiation if they were 10.0 m from the radiation source. How much radiation would they be exposed to if they were instead:    20.0 m from the radiation source    100. m from the radiation source    2.5 m from the radiation source      Rearrange the equation below to solve for :         Use the rearranged equation in question 5 to answer the following question: A worker needs to keep their radiation exposure below 5.0 mGy. If they would be exposed to 15 mGy of radiation at a distance of 2.5 m, what is the closest they can get to the radiation source without exceeding their maximum dose?     Half-life on radioisotopes   Radioactive isotopes decay in a random fashion. As they decay, the atoms in the sample change and the sample can gradually lose its radioactive properties, simply because there is less and less of the original radioactive isotope left. We measure the decay rate of radioactive isotopes using half-lives. One half life is the amount of time required to have the decay rate of a substance decrease by a factor of one-half. So after one half life, half of the original isotope remains and the decay rate will thus be ½ of what it originally was. After a second half life has passed, one-half of one-half of the original radioactive isotope will remain (or ¼). After each subsequent half-life the amount of original radioactive isotope will again decrease by ½. We can use this information to derive a formula to calculate the amount of radioactive isotope or the decay rate after a given amount of time has passed:     In this formula is the decay rate or amount of isotope at time t and is the original rate or amount. The variables and represent the time that has passed and the half-life of the isotope respectively. So if we began with 17 mCi of radioactive material that has a half-life of 8 days and 30 days have passed, we’d have mCi of radioactive material left. Half lives of isotopes can vary dramatically with short ones having half-lives of seconds or minutes and long ones having half-lives of thousands of years. Isotopes that are used clinically generally have short half-lives (on the order of days or weeks) because that means that they will decay at a fast rate meaning that they can produce their useful radiation dose more quickly with less material required.   Exercise 3:      After 5 half lives, what fraction of the original radioactive material will remain?      How about after 7 half-lives?        After 4 half-lives what percentage of the original radioactive material will remain? Round to 3 significant figures      If 28.5 mg of radioactive material with a half live of 17 days is allowed to decay for 8 days, then how much will remain? Round to 3 significant figures      5.2 x 10 7 Bq of radioactive material is purchased. It has a half life of 23 hours. After exactly 7 days, how much radioactive material will remain? Round to 2 significant figures      A lab orders 16 mCi of radioactive material. After 8 days, 2.0 mCi remains. What is the half life of the material? Round to the nearest tenth of a day.

  "body": " Compounds 1    Ionic compounds vs. covalent compounds    Simple ionic compounds with only two elements    How can we figure out the charge on the ions    How do we figure out the chemical formula for the ionic compound    How do we name ionic compounds       Section 1: Ionic compounds   To review, compounds are pure substances that consist of atoms of various elements that are joined together in a specific ratio. There are two different classes of compounds: ionic compounds and covalent\/molecular compounds. In this section, we’ll be learning about the differences between ionic compounds and covalent compounds. What distinguishes ionic compounds from covalent\/molecular compounds is the way in which the atoms are joined together.   Ionic compounds are made up of ions that are joined together by electrostatic forces . Ions are particles that have a net charge, either a positive or a negative charge. Ions can either be positively charged ( cations ) or negatively charges ( anions ). Additionally, ions can either consist of one atom (a monoatomic ion) or of several atoms that are joined together to form a larger charged unit (a polyatomic ion). An ionic compound consists of cations and anions that are held together because their opposite charges attract one another (electrostatic forces).   Covalent compounds (also known as molecular compounds ) are formed from atoms that are joined together by sharing electrons. Ionic compounds always consist of multiple ions, which are separate units that are attracted to one another. In contrast, covalent compounds consist of a single unit that is comprised of all of the component atoms. Within this unit, the atoms are held together by the sharing of electrons. This unit of a covalent compound is called a molecule .  Ionic compounds generally (but not always…we’ll learn about the exceptions later) consist of a metal and one or more non-metals. Covalent compounds, on the other hand, consist exclusively of non-metals. This can be useful in allowing us to identify whether a compound is an ionic or covalent compound. Recall that metals can be found on the left side of the periodic table whereas non-metals can be found exclusively on the upper right. Thus, if a compound contains a metal, we can be confident that it is an ionic compound. If a compound doesn’t contain a metal, it is usually a covalent compound (again, we’ll learn about exceptions to this in a later section).  These atomic-level differences between ionic and covalent compounds lead to very different physical properties. The physical properties that we’ll be learning about are melting point and behavior in solution. In general, ionic compounds have much higher melting points than covalent compounds. In a solid ionic compound, the ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces as we learned above. In a solid covalent compound, the various molecules are themselves held together, but by much weaker intermolecular forces . We’ll discuss intermolecular forces in much more detail later in this chapter. Since the forces that hold together ions in an ionic compound are much stronger than the intermolecular forces that hold together molecules in a covalent compound, more energy is required to break the bonds in an ionic compound. This results in a higher melting point.  There is a big difference between ionic and covalent compounds when it comes to how they can dissolve in water to form a solution. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the electrostatic interactions between the ions are replaced by interactions between the ions and water. Basically, the ions that make up the ionic compound separate from one another and get surrounded by water molecules. When covalent compounds dissolve in water, they remain as intact molecules. Each molecule is surrounded by water molecules similar to what is seen for an ionic compound. The difference is that molecules remain intact whereas the ions that make up ionic compounds separate from one another.   Exercise 1:      Classify the following as a monoatomic cation, a monoatomic anion, a polyatomic cation, or a polyatomic anion      Ca 2+      Mn 2+      NH 4 +      ClO 4 -      Cl -      O 2-      SO 4 2-        What term describes the forces that hold together the ions in an ionic compound?      What term describes all of the forces that hold together molecules in a molecular compound?      For each of the following, do they describe a molecular compound or an ionic compound      Parts of the chemical formula break apart when they are dissolved into water      Low melting points      Usually contains metal ions        Section 2: Ions   In this section, we’ll be learning about how atoms form ions. First of all, what is an ion. We’ve learned that an ion is a species that is charged. So how does it get its charge? It does so by having extra electrons or by lacking electrons. If an atom has more electrons than protons, then its charge will be negative and it will be an anion. If an atom has fewer electrons than protons, then the atom will be positively charges, and it will be a cation. Importantly, the number of protons will NEVER change for an element. Ions are created by either adding or removing electrons.  Why do some atoms gain electrons whereas other atoms lose them? Why do some gain\/lose a single electron whereas others gain\/lose multiple? To understand this, we need to revisit electron configurations. The most stable elements on the periodic table are the noble gases. Why are they so stable? It turns out that they are stable because their orbitals are either completely filled or completely empty! For instance, the electron configuration of helium is and the electron configuration of neon is (recall that a set of s-orbitals hold 2 electrons, a set of p orbitals can hold 6…etc.). For all of the noble gases except helium, they have 8 valence electrons (helium has 2). Thus the most stable electron configurations will have 8 valence electrons, something known as the octet rule .  For many elements, they form ions in order to get an electron configuration that is the same as a noble gas. For instance, if a group 1 metal loses a single electron, then it will have the same electron configuration as a noble gas (ex. the electron configuration of sodium is and if it loses its outermost valence electron then its electron configuration will simply be or simply ). Because of this, group 1 metals tend to lose a single electron to form ions. Elements in group 2 tend to lose 2 electrons, because this will give them an electron configuration that is the same as a noble gas as well. On the other side of the periodic table, the halogens (group 17 or 7A) have electron configurations that are a single electron away from resembling a noble gas. In order for them to reach a noble gas configuration, they have to GAIN one electron. As a result they’ll form negatively charged anions. Elements in group 16 will likewise gain two electrons to achieve a noble gas electron configuration.  Many of the elements in the periodic table have predictable charges in ionic compounds. The metals in group 1 will always have a +1 charge. The metals in group 2 will always have a +2 charge. Aluminum will likewise always have a +3 charge. The halogens (group 17 or 7A) will always for anions with a -1 charge. The non-metals in group 16 (6A) will gain two electrons to form -2 anions. The non-metals in group 15 (5A), nitrogen and phosphorus, can gain 3 electrons to form -3 anions. Hydrogen is a rather unique element, in that it can lose one electron (forming a +1 ion with completely empty orbitals) or gain an electron to resemble helium (forming a -1 anion).   Exercise 2:      What is the electron configuration and charge of…      Calcium if it loses two electrons      Chlorine if it gains one electron      Hydrogen if it gains one electron      Hydrogen if it loses one electron      Sodium if it loses one electron      Aluminum if it loses 3 electrons      Phosphorus if it gains 3 electrons        Each of the ions in question 1 are common in ionic compounds. What do you notice about the electron configuration of each of the ions in question 1? Do you notice a pattern?      Which of the ions in question 1 are cations? Which are anions?      Keeping in mind that ions like to form electron configurations with either completely full or completely empty valence shells, what is the charge on each of the ions in the following ionic compounds. Their position on the periodic table may help.      Sodium ion      Strontium ion      Aluminum ion      Bromine ion      Sulfur ion      Nitrogen ion        Section 3: Simple ionic compounds   Ionic compounds are formed by combining cations and anions. When they are combined, they must do so in such a way that the total positive charge is equal to the total negative charge. Sometimes this is simple. For instance a ion can be combined with a ion in a 1:1 ratio because the +1 charge from the sodium balances the -1 charge from the chlorine. There would therefore be one of each ion in the chemical formula for this compound, and we’d write it simply as (note: if there’s one of an element in a chemical formula the 1 is not written). On the other hand, if we wanted to make an ionic compound by joining a ion with a ion, then we’d require 2 ions to balance the +2 charge on the calcium ion. Thus, they’d combine to form the compound (the number of ions is written as a subscript). Also, note that when we write the chemical formula of an ionic compound that we don’t include the charges of the ions!   Ionic compounds can be specified by their chemical formula (as covered above) or by their name. How do we name ionic compounds? Naming ionic compounds is easy. They consist of two separate words. The first word is the name of the cation, and the second word is the name of the anion. For simple ionic compounds that have metal cations with known charges, naming the cation is easy…it’s simply the name of that metal. The name of the anion is more complex. To name the anion, we start with the name of the element, but we delete the ending of the name and replace it with -ide. See the table below:        Element  Anion name    Oxygen  Oxide    Chlorine  Chloride    Bromine  Bromide    Nitrogen  Nitride    Phosphorous  Phosphide     Thus the name of is sodium chloride and would be calcium bromide. When we’re naming ionic compounds, we NEVER use prefixes to indicate the number of ions present. The number of ions is implied by our knowledge about the ions themselves and their charges. To illustrate this, lets figure out the chemical formula for magnesium oxide. We know that this compound consists of magnesium and oxygen. Based on their locations in the periodic table, we can conclude that magnesium would form a +2 ion and that oxygen would form a -2 ion. In order to get the positive and negative charges to balance, we’d need a 1:1 ratio so the correct formula would simply be .   Exercise 3:      Try to balance the positive and negative charge to create ionic compounds. What is the correct formula be for the following ionic compounds?

They resemble noble gases.      Each one that loses electrons is a cation, the ones that gain electrons are anions      Keeping in mind that ions like to form electron configurations with either completely full or completely empty valence shells, what is the charge on each of the ions in the following ionic compounds. Their position on the periodic table may help.      +1      +2      +3      -1      -2      -3        Exercise 3:      Try to balance the positive and negative charge to create ionic compounds.

However, for many metals (such as the transition metals) it is unrealistic to expect them to lose enough electrons to achieve the same electron configuration as a noble gas. Instead, these metals will lose fewer electrons in an effort to empty out their outer s or p orbitals, or to obtain other stable electron configurations. Often there are multiple ways for these metals to achieve stable states, and therefore these metals can adopt different charge states. For instance, iron has the electron configuration . Iron can empty out its 4s shell, losing 2 electrons in the process, and forming a Fe 2+ ion. Alternatively, iron can empty its 4s shell AND lose an electron from its 3d shell. This results in a semi-stable half-filled 3d shell. In this case, iron has lost 3 electrons, forming a Fe 3+ ion in the process.  So which metals have variable charges and which ones don’t? The metals with known charges are listed below:    Metals in group 1 (+1 charge)    Metals in group 2 (+2 charge)    C.A.Z.A.G. metals    Cd, cadmium (+2 charge)    Al, aluminum (+3 charge)    Zn, zinc (+2 charge)    Ag, silver (+1 charge)    Ga, gallium (+3 charge)      All other metals in the periodic table have more than one possible charge.  How are we supposed to know what the charge of a metal is in an ionic compound if it has a metal with variable charges. When naming these types of ionic compounds, we specify the charge of the metal by putting the charge in parentheses as a Roman numeral (see the table below). Importantly, we ONLY do this if the metal in the ionic compound has variable charges. So the name iron (III) chloride is an ionic compound between Fe 3+ and Cl - ; the (III) specifies that the charge on the iron is 3+. Chloride is in group 17, and thus we can determine that its charge is -1 (because it only needs one extra electron to have a noble gas electron configuration). From this information, we can determine that the formula for iron (III) chloride must be because 3 chloride ions would be needed to balance out the charge of the iron.        Number  Roman numeral    1  I    2  II    3  III    4  IV    5  V    6  VI    7  VII    8  VIII     Likewise, we can figure out the name of an ionic compound that involves a metal with variable charges by figuring out the charge on the metal by looking at the known charge on the anion. For example, if you were tasked with naming the compound , you’d first need to recognize that tin is a metal with variable charges. In order to figure out its charge, we need to determine that oxide ions have a charge of -2. Since there are two oxides in the chemical formula, the total negative charge is 2(-2) = -4. The one Sn ion must have a positive charge that balances the negative charges from the oxides. Therefore the cation is Sn 4+ . To name the compound, we name the cation along with the charge in parentheses and then we name the anion. So the name of this compound is tin (IV) oxide.   Exercise 1:      What is the charge on the metal in the following ionic compounds. You need to figure out the charge on the metal based on the identity and quantity of the non-metals and the quantity of the metal in the compound. Remember that the positive and negative charges need to balance.     FeCl 3     FeCl 2     CoO    OsO 4     MnN    Sn 3 N 4     Sb 2 O 5        Name the ionic compounds in part 1. Remember that if an ionic compound has a metal with variable charges, then the charge on the metal is specified with a roman numeral in parentheses after the metal name      What are the formulas for the following compounds      Copper (I) sulfide      Copper (II) sulfide      Nickel (II) oxide      Manganese (III) chloride      Manganese (VII) oxide      Lead (IV) chloride        Section 2: Polyatomic ions   There are ions (both cations and anions) that consist of more than one atom, and these are called polyatomic  ions . These atoms are joined together by sharing electrons (covalent bonds) to form a single unit. This collective unit of atoms contains fewer electrons (if it’s a cation) or extra electrons (if it’s an anion), and thus the entire unit has a charge. We’ll explore the structures of these polyatomic ions later in this chapter. For now, we won’t worry about their structure. Rather we’ll focus on their component atoms and charges alone.  Polyatomic ions have names, formulas, and charges that must be memorized. There are some patterns to their naming that become apparent after close inspection, and these patterns will be looked at as a part of the exercises below. The polyatomic ions that you are responsible for knowing are listed in the table below:         Name  Charge  Formula with charge    Ammonium  +1     Carbonate  -2     Hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate)  -1     Phosphate  -3     Hydrogen phosphate (or phosphate dibasic)  -2     Dihydrogen phosphate (or phosphate monobasic)  -1     Sulfate  -2     Sulfite  -2     Nitrate  -1     Nitrite  -1     Hydroxide  -1     Acetate  -1      We can name ionic compounds that include polyatomic ions by following the same rules that we learned previously: we simply name the cation (with the charge, if needed) and then the anion. So if you have to name , you first of all, need to recognize that it’s an ionic compound (because it has a metal and nonmetals). Then you need to remember that sodium has a known charge (because it’s in group 1) and thus we won’t specify its charge in the name. Lastly, you need to recognize that is included in the formula and is called nitrate. Therefore, this compound is called sodium nitrate.  One additional complication that arises when discussing polyatomic ions is that there is one polyatomic ion, ammonium, that is a cation. Thus, we can have ionic compounds that don’t have metals. They will instead have ammonium ( ) as a part of their formula. So is an ionic compound that consists of an ammonium cation and a chloride anion. It is therefore named ammonium chloride.  Sometimes chemical formulas will require that we include more than one polyatomic ion in order to balance the positive and negative charges. To specify this, the polyatomic ion is put inside of parentheses and a subscript number is written after the parentheses to indicate the number of polyatomic ions present. So if we were making a compound between and , we’d need two nitrate ions to balance the charge, and the chemical formula would thus be written as .   Exercise 2:      Notice the pattern in the yellow and orange cells in the table above. What happens to the name and charge of the polyatomic ion as hydrogens are added?      Notice the pattern in the green and blue cells in the table above. What happens to the formula and charge when an -ate ending is change to -ite?      What would the correct formula be for the following ionic compounds. If you need multiple polyatomic ions, place parentheses around the ion and specify how many of them there are with a subscript after the parentheses.      Sodium carbonate      Potassium bicarbonate      Calcium hydroxide      Iron (II) phosphate      Copper (I) nitrite      Zinc acetate      Ammonium sulfate      Ammonium acetate        Name the following ionic compounds                                                   Key:   Exercise 1:     What is the charge on the metal in the following ionic compounds. You need to figure out the charge on the metal based on the identity and quantity of the non-metals and the quantity of the metal in the compound.

  "body": " Compounds 3   Making a covalent bond    Covalent compounds are formed when atoms share electrons. When two electrons are shared between two atoms, this forms a covalent bond . Covalent bonds are quite strong and are difficult to break. Thus covalent compounds remain together as discrete units called molecules , even when dissolved, melted, or boiled.  Before we discuss covalent compounds further, let’s learn rules that allow us to draw the Lewis dot structure for an atom:    Write the element symbol    Surround it with the valence electrons written as dots    There are 4 sides around the symbol (each side represents an outer shell atomic orbital-there is one outer s-orbital and 3 outer p-orbitals for most elements except hydrogen)    Place a maximum of 2 dots per side; don’t start pairing until you have to    Which side does NOT matter      How do covalent bonds form and how does sharing electrons help to hold together two atoms? Orbitals are most stable when they have completely filled (or completely empty orbitals). When two atoms come together, their atomic orbitals can combine together to form molecular orbitals . These molecular orbitals are shared between the two atoms and have shapes that resemble the s and p orbitals if they overlap with one another. Importantly, these are still orbitals, and thus molecular orbitals can still only hold 2 electrons.  Recall from earlier this chapter that the most stable electron configuration for most atoms is 8 valence electrons, because 8 electrons is the number required to completely fill the outer shell s (one of them) and p (three of them) orbitals. This is called the octet rule . So how can we fulfill the octet rule without adding or removing electrons?  We do this by forming molecular orbitals (which reduces the number of orbitals that have to be filled) and by sharing electrons between the atoms in these molecular orbitals. Consider the molecule . Each fluorine has 7 valence electrons, for a total of 14 valence electrons. Each fluorine also has a 4 outer shell orbitals, one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals, for a grand total of 8 outer shell orbitals. If two of those orbitals are combined into one molecular orbital, then the total number of outer shell orbitals is only 7. These 7 orbitals can be filled perfectly by the 14 electrons. Two of these electrons are shared between the two fluorine atoms in the molecular orbital and thus form the bond that links them together. See the figure below:    A screenshot of a video game AI-generated content may be incorrect.   The Lewis dot structures of 2 fluorine atoms are shown above. The circles are shown to emphasize the orbitals that the electrons are in. Note: normally a Lewis dot structure does NOT include these circles. In the bottom portion, the two fluorine atoms are joined together by a covalent bond. The red orbital is a molecular orbital that was created by fusing two atomic orbitals together. It contain electrons that came from both of the fluorine atoms.  Hydrogen is an important common exception to the octet rule. The nearest noble gas to hydrogen is helium, which has a completely filled 1 st shell that only requires two electrons. So hydrogen obeys the duet rule for valence electrons; it wants to have two valence electrons rather than 8.   Exercise 1:      Draw the Lewis dot structure for:      Hydrogen      Helium      Chlorine      Oxygen      Nitrogen      Carbon        Based on the number of valence electrons listed below, complete the “Typical number of bonds” column in the table below. Recall that atoms can essentially acquire an extra electron by having them shared with them through a bond.            Element  Number of valence electrons  Typical number of bonds in a Lewis structure    H  1     He  2     F  7     O  6     N  5     C  4     S  6     Ne  8       Lewis structures: Basic rules   When it comes to figuring out the structure of larger covalent molecules, the same principles apply (the octet rule, the duet rule, and combining atomic orbitals to form a shared molecular orbital). However, there are additional complexities that also get introduced. For instance, which atoms should be bound to which other atoms? Also, some atoms are capable of forming more than one bond. Carbon, for instance, has 4 valence electrons. That means that it needs 4 other electrons to be shared with it to reach its octet. That means that carbon likes to form 4 covalent bonds!  To help facilitate drawing Lewis structures, there are some basic procedural steps that you should follow. We’ll begin with the basic rules and then increase the complexity with more rules in later sections.   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:      Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)      Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!      Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining      Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!      More rules later…      Exercise 2:      How many valence electrons are in…                                     Draw Lewis dot structures for the following compounds                                                    Lewis structures: Multiple bonds   Try to draw the Lewis structure of (or see the figure below). If you follow the rules above, you quickly find that you have a problem, you can’t make an octet around each oxygen atom. How are we supposed to satisfy the octet rule, then?  We can satisfy the octet rule on both atoms by joining two additional atomic orbitals to form a second molecular orbital and by using this additional molecular orbital to share another pair of electrons. This creates a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. Each bond is a separate molecular orbital that contains a pair of shared electrons.  In some cases, such as when we try to draw the Lewis structure for , we need to join still another pair of atomic orbitals to form a third molecular orbital that we can use to share a third pair of electrons. This creates a triple bond.  The steps for drawing a Lewis structure can be added onto with an additional rule that covers these situations:   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:      Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)      Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!      Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining      Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!      If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2 nd bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!      Exercise 3:      Consider the drawing below that a student might make along the way to figuring out the Lewis structure of SeO. Explain how you know that the structure isn’t finished. Why can’t the student add more electrons to the structure?      Draw the Lewis structures of the following molecules. Keep in mind the number of bonds that each atom likes to form (from Exercise 1).

  "body": " Compounds 4   Section 1: Lewis structures: Formal charge   In many cases, a covalent compound will have atoms that are charged. Sometimes, multiple atoms in the structure will be charged, other times just a single atom. Sometimes the charges will cancel out (for instance if a structure has one atom with a +1 charge and another with a -1 charge), but in other cases they won’t (and we have a polyatomic ion). How then are we to figure out whether or not an atom in a structure is charged or not?  To figure out the formal charge on an atom in a Lewis structure, we apply the rules listed below:  Rules for formal charges:    If the atom is making its typical number of bonds, it DOES NOT have a formal charge    Atoms want to be surrounded by an octet (or duet) of electrons, but they don’t own all of them    Atoms own all of their lone pair electrons    Atoms own half of the electrons in the bonds connected to them      Atoms want to own their number of valence electrons    Charge=number of valence electrons desired-number of electrons owned in the structure    We can get clues from looking at a structure about what atom(s) are likely to have formal charges. Recall from an earlier exercise, how we can figure out the typical number of bonds that an atom will make (example: oxygen has 6 valence electrons so it needs 2 bonds to get to its octet). When an atom makes its typical number of bonds in a structure, that atom will typically have a charge of zero. If the atom is making a different number of bonds, then it is more likely to have a formal charge. You can use this to help you quickly narrow down which atoms are likely to have a charge in a structure. For example, oxygen atoms with 2 bonds almost always have a formal charge of zero. Oxygen atoms with one bond and 3 bonds are typically negatively and positively charged, respectively. (see the figure below)  Now that we know how to compute the formal charge on atoms in a Lewis structure, we should update our rules for Lewis structures with one additional step:   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:     Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)    Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!    Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining    Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!    If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2 nd bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!    Figure out the formal charge on the atoms (if any). List the formal charge next to the atom and circle it for emphasis     Exercise 1:      In the structure shown below (it’s NOT a correct structure at this point…), for each of the atoms, determine a) the number of electrons around the atom, b) the number of electrons that that each atom “owns”, c) the typical number of valence electrons for each atom, and d) the formal charge on each atom. NOTE THAT THE OXYGEN ATOMS HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF BONDS AND LONE-PAIRS OF ELECTRONS…SO ONCE YOU’VE FIGURED OUT ONE OF THEM, THE OTHERS ARE THE SAME…       A group of red text on a black background AI-generated content may be incorrect.      Add formal charges to the indicated atoms in the structures shown below            A blackboard with red writing on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.           A black background with red writing on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.           A group of red writing on a black background AI-generated content may be incorrect.       Draw the following Lewis dot structures and indicate which atom has the formal charge                                 Section 2: Lewis structures: Exceptions to the octet rule   Some atoms are capable of having more than an octet of electrons around them. Atoms in the 3 rd period of the periodic table and beyond are large enough that they can accommodate more electrons in their outer shell. In addition, they are not limited to just s and p orbitals; they also have d-orbitals which allow them to hold more than 8 electrons. To account for this, we have to add to some of our rules (highlighted in red) and also add an extra rule at the end.   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:     Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens). Remember that atoms in the 3 rd period and below may be capable of making more than their typical number of bonds.    Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!    Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining    Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons! If you have extra electrons after giving every atom an octet, go ahead and place the additional electrons around an atom that’s from the 3 rd period or lower (usually the central atom in your structure).    If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2 nd bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!    Figure out the formal charge on the atoms (if any). List the formal charge next to the atom and circle it for emphasis    If the central atom is in the 3 rd period or lower, we have to check to see if it should make additional bonds and thereby break the octet rule. Try moving a lone pair from an outer atom and forming an additional bond to the center atom. Re-evaluate the formal charges. Repeat step 7 as needed. You are trying to…    Eliminate atoms with multiple charges (ie. +2 or -2)    Minimize the number of atoms with a charge    Prevent adjacent like-charges (ie. No negative charges on adjacent atoms…adjacent positive and negative charges can be okay)    Note: Usually the central atom will end up with a charge of 0       Exercise 2:      Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules:                                 Section 3: Structures of polyatomic ions   In this section, we’re not going to be adding any new knowledge. Instead, we’ll be tying your new skills to material that you’ve learned previously. Polyatomic ions are ions that consist of multiple atoms that are bound together through covalent bonds. In this section you’ll be determining the structure of polyatomic ions that we’ve previously covered and you’ll be determining which atom(s) in the structure contain the formal charges.   Exercise 3:      Draw the Lewis structure of   with only a single bond between the phosphorous and each oxygen atom      Figure out the formal charge on each of the atoms      Convert one of the lone pairs of electrons on one of the oxygens into a double bond between the P and O. Recompute the formal charges      Repeat step b using another oxygen atom in the structure. Which structure has the least number of charges, the one in a, b, or c?        Repeat the steps in the problem above (you may need to repeat step b additional times) to figure out the correct Lewis structure of…                       Why don’t we need to do step b in problem 1 if we’re figuring out the structure of  .

Therefore you can’t make additional bonds between it and the oxygen atoms    "

For now, we’ll limit our focus to binary (only two atom types) covalent compounds. We name binary diatomic compounds in a similar way that we name diatomic ionic compounds. We are going to name the first atom and then the second atom with its ending swapped for -ide. However, we also add on a prefix to both the first and second word that indicates how many atoms there are (with one exception). We have to do this because the atoms aren’t charged and thus we can’t figure out how many are present from the name alone. So what are these prefixes and what’s the exception? The prefixes are listed in the table below. The exception to adding prefixes is that we don’t add “mono-“ to the first word if there is only one.        Number  Prefix    1  mono (not used on the first word)    2  di    3  tri    4  tetra    5  penta    6  hexa    7  hepta    8  octa    9  nona    10  deca      Exercise 1:      What is the formula for the following compounds:      Carbon dioxide      Nitrogen trihydride      Disulfur dichloride      Triphosphorous pentafluoride        Name the following compounds                            Geometry   In chemistry, the shape of a molecule can be incredibly important. The shape of a pharmaceutical molecule allows it to properly interact with its biological target. The shape of a protein controls its function inside of a cell, allowing for things like metabolism and movement to occur. In order to understand the shape of complex molecules, we must first understand the shape\/geometry around a single atom within a covalent compound. Two or more electron groups are found around the atom whose geometry we’re considering. An electron group is defined as either a lone pair of electrons or an atom (or group of atoms) that is bound directly to the atom that we’re considering. If we know the number of electron groups, then we can determine the electron geometry using VSEPR theory. This theory states that the electron groups will spread out in 3D space as much as possible in order to maximize the distance between them. The electron geometries that we observe in molecules are dependent on the number of electron groups. If we have two electron groups around a central atom, then the best way for nature to separate them is to have them on completely opposite sides of the central atom. This creates a linear arrangement of our two electron groups and the central atom, and thus this electron geometry is called “linear” and has a bond angle of 180 degrees. If three electron groups are present, then they spread out in a flat triangular arrangement and the geometry is called “trigonal planar” and has bond angles of 120 degrees. With four electron groups, they must spread out in a 3D arrangement called “tetrahedral” with bond angles of 109.5 degrees (see the table below).  The electron geometry is useful information, but often we don’t care about where the lone pairs of electrons are and want to focus solely on the shape of the atoms in a molecule. When we’re figuring this out, we’re determining the molecular geometry (or molecular shape). The molecular geometries are determined by first figuring out the electron geometry. Once we’ve done this, we can ignore\/”cover-up” the electron groups that are lone-pairs of electrons, allowing us to focus on the ones that are groups of atoms. It’s important to note that the lone pairs of electrons are still present and still taking up space, but we’re simply choosing to ignore them. Thus if we have 3 electron groups around a central atom, but one of them is a lone pair of electrons, then the electron geometry is trigonal planar. If we cover up one of the electron groups, the resulting molecular geometry is called “bent” and it still has a bond angle of 120 degrees…the same as its electron geometry. If we have 4 electron groups, the electron geometry is tetrahedral and we have bond angles of 109.5 degrees. If one of the groups is a lone pair of electrons, then the molecular geometry has a non-flat triagonal molecular geometry called “trigonal pyramidal”. If two of the electron groups are lone pairs             Number of electron groups  Electron geometry  Electron geometry appearance  Bond angle  Number of lone pairs of electrons  Molecular shape  Molecular shape appearance    2  Linear   180 o  0  Linear     3  Trigonal planar   120 o  0  Trigonal planar         1  Bent     4  Tetrahedral   109.5 o  0  Tetrahedral         1  Trigonal pyramidal         2  Bent      In the diagrams shown, X represents the central atom. E is an electron group (either an atom or a lone pair of electrons). A represents another atom. Wedge bonds indicate that the bond is coming out of the paper at you. A dashed bond indicates that the bond is going away from you.   Exercise 2:      What are the electron geometries and molecular shapes described by the following:      2 electron groups, no lone pairs      3 electron groups, no lone pairs      4 electron groups, 1 lone pair of electrons      3 electron groups, 1 lone pair of electrons      4 electron groups, no lone pairs of electrons      4 electron groups, 2 lone pairs of electrons        Based on the Lewis structures below, determine the electron geometries, molecular shapes, and the bond angles.

O3 Lewis Structure - Chemistry Steps       What is the electron and molecular geometries in the following compounds? What are the bond angles?:      Carbon tetrachloride      Nitrogen trihydride      Carbonate      Sulfur dioxide        Polarity and intermolecular forces   When considering the types of bonding that are observed in chemistry, we use two distinct terms: ionic bonding and covalent bonding. In actuality, there are bonds that are somewhat in-between as well, where the electrons are being shared, but in a non-equal way. This results in one of the atoms having slightly more electrons than it should (producing a partial negative charge, depicted as ) and one having slightly fewer than it should (producing a partial positive charge, depicted as ). This type of bond is called a polar covalent bond because it has partial positive and negatively charged ends, or poles. A covalent bond where the electrons are shared equally is called a nonpolar covalent bond .  How can we figure out if electrons will be shared equally between two atoms? To determine this, we need to look at the electronegativity value of each of the bonded atoms. Electronegativity is a measure of how much an atom will attract additional electrons towards itself. The highest electronegativity value is fluorine, which will attract electrons the strongest. The lowest values are seen at the bottom left of the periodic table. See the chart in the link: Electronegativity chart . To determine if a bond is polar, we subtract the electronegativity values of the two bound atoms. If the difference is <0.5, then the electrons are shared more-or-less equally and the bond is non-polar. If the difference is 0.5-1.7 then the bond is a polar covalent bond, with the atom with the greater electronegativity value having the partial negative charge . If the difference is greater than 1.7, then the bond is likely an ionic bond.  A polar molecule is one that has a partially positive side and a partial negative side. If a molecule has polar covalent bonds then the molecule itself is often (but not always polar). The exception to this is when the polar covalent bonds cancel out one another due to a symmetric geometry. If the molecular geometry is either linear, trigonal planar, or tetrahedral (ie. one of the molecular geometries that doesn’t have a lone pair) AND the bonds are equivalent, then the polarities of the bonds will cancel out, resulting a case where we have polar bonds but a non-polar molecule. So in order to determine if a molecule is polar, we have to:    Ask if it has polar bonds    Make sure that the polar bonds don’t cancel each other out     How can polarity cancel out in a molecule?   There are two requirements:    The polar bonds must be equivalent in strength (generally they will be bonds between identical elements)    The polar bonds must be symmetric    Generally this means that the molecular shape must be tetrahedral, trigonal, planar, or linear    There cannot be lone pairs of electrons on the central atom      The polarity (or non-polarity) of a molecule determines how it is able to interact with other molecules. This is useful for understanding things like how DNA is held together, what gives proteins their shapes, how pharmaceuticals interact with proteins, etc. There are 4 types of intermolecular forces that we’re going to discuss: ionic bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and London dispersion forces. We’ve already learned about ionic bonds. This is the attraction between cations and anions that holds together ionic compounds. Basically any time we have a full positive or negative charge on an atom or a molecule, it will be able to interact with ionic bonds.  Dipole-dipole interactions are like ionic bonds in that a positive charge attracts a negative charge, but the distinguishing feature is that the charges are partial charges in this case. Polar molecules have partial positive and partial negative ends and are thus able to form dipole-dipole interactions with one another. This is why a polar molecule like sugar is able to interact with another polar molecule like water, allowing water to dissolve sugar.  Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when we have a polar N-H, O-H, or H-F bond that is able to interact with a lone pair of electrons. The hydrogen atom in each of the listed bonds has a partial positive charge. However, since hydrogen only has one electron, having it be partially positively charged is basically exposing a bare nucleus, allowing it to form bonds that are much stronger than other dipole-dipole interactions. The partially positively charged hydrogen atom is attracted to the partial negative charge of a lone-pair of electrons, forming a special type of dipole-dipole interaction (because of the exposed hydrogen nucleus) that we call a hydrogen bond.  London dispersion forces are the weakest of all of the intermolecular forces. They are a type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when temporary dipoles form. In every molecule the electrons are continually shifting. Sometimes this shifting\/movement of electrons creates a partial charge imbalance in the molecule, resulting in a partial negative and partial positive charge. These partial charges can attract those of adjacent molecules. Since these forces are dependent on the normal movement of electrons in any molecule, ALL molecules can interact with London dispersion forces. These forces are the reason why non-polar molecules can still interact with one another and simply don’t fly apart. Gasoline, for instance, is very non-polar but the molecules interact with one another strongly enough to hold together in a liquid form at room temperature.  In terms of strength, ionic bonds are the strongest due to the complete positive and negative charges. Hydrogen bonds are next, followed by dipole-dipole interactions. Last, in terms of strength, are London dispersion forces.   Intermolecular forces ordered according to strength:    Strongest     Ionic bonds    Ions are required    Example: Na+ and Cl-      Hydrogen bonds    A polar N-H, O-H, or F-H bond is required and a lone pair of electrons    Example:       Dipole-dipole interactions    A polar molecule is required    Example:       London dispersion forces    Applies to all molecules.

  "title": "Reactions 1",
  "body": " Reactions 1   Classes of chemical reactions   A chemical reaction is the process of converting one or more pure substances into others. In order to do this, nature does not create or destroy atoms (that only happens in nuclear reactions, as is covered in chapter 5). Instead, atoms are swapped between compounds. Bonds in the reactant compounds are broken and new bonds are formed to create the product compounds. See the example below:     In this example, compounds AX and BY are the reactants . AB and XY are the products of the reaction. Chemical reactions are always written with the reactants on the left, products on the right, and a reaction arrow separating them. In the example above, the bonds between A and X and B and Y are broken so that A can form a new bond with B and X with Y.  In chemical reactions, in addition to the chemical formulas of the reactants and products, we see additional numbers and symbols. See the example below:     In this example, the reactants H 2 and O 2 are reacting to form water (H 2 O). In front of the chemical formulas, there are sometimes additional numbers called coefficients . These numbers are used to tell how many of those elements or compounds are required for the reaction to be balanced (more on this in another lesson). After the formulas for the elements or compounds, it is quite common to see either (g), (l), (s), or (aq) listed. These symbols state whether the substance is a gas (g), liquid (l), or solid (s) or can indicate that the substance is dissolved in water (aq) (this stands for “aqueous”).  When learning about chemical reactions, it can be very helpful to classify the reactions. This allow us to begin to recognize patterns that we can use to predict what will happen in other chemical reactions. We’ll learn several different ways of classifying reactions, beginning in this exercise where we will classify reactions by the numbers of reactants\/products and whether the reactants\/products are elements or compounds. We’ll start with the simplest types of reactions:  Type 1: Addition reaction (sometimes called a combination reaction ): Two or more pure substances combine to make one. Example:     Type 2: Decomposition reaction : One substance breaks apart into two or more substances. Example:      An important note to be aware of: recall that some elements exist as diatomic compounds. This is very common with non-metals and they are typically gasses (with a few exaceptions) at room temperature. You need to know that the following elements exist as diatomic compounds:         Exercise 1:      Classify the following reactions as addition (combination) reactions or decomposition reactions:                  Write the following reactions using chemical formulas and coefficients. Indicate the state of the substance using the symbols learned above:      Two units of solid iron (III) hydroxide decompose into one unit of solid iron (III) oxide and three molecules of liquid water      Two units of solid silver bromide decay into two atoms of silver metal and one molecule of liquid bromine.      Two molecules of nitrogen gas combine with three molecules of hydrogen gas to produce two molecules of gasseous nitrogen trihydride        Slightly more complex reactions   Type 3: Single-replacement reaction : One compound reacts with a pure element. The element swaps with an atom in the compound. Example:     Type 4: Double-replacement reaction : Two compounds react with one another. Atoms from both compounds swap with one another. Example:     One common type of double-replacement reaction is a precipitation reaction. In a precipitation reaction, both reactants are ionic compounds that are dissolved in water (ie. aqueous, aq). When the reactants are combined, one of the combinations of a cation and an anion results in a compound that is insoluble in water, meaning that it cannot be dissolved by water. As a result, crystals of that insoluble ionic compound form in the reaction. Why are some ionic compounds soluble and others aren’t? Basically, in order for an ionic compound to dissolve in water, its ions must separate from one another and form new interactions with the polar water molecules (through ion-dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding). If the interactions that the ions form with water are stronger than the interactions holding the ionic compound together, then water will “win” and the ionic compound will dissolve. If the bonds holding the ionic compound together are stronger than the interactions that the ions can form with water, then the ionic compound “wins” and the ionic compound will not dissolve in water.  There are some rules about solubility of ionic compounds that you’ll need to know. You need to apply these rules in this order!    Compounds containing ammonium, magnesium, or alkali metal cations (group I metals), and\/or nitrate, and acetate anions are soluble    Compounds containing the cation of silver, lead, or mercury are insoluble    Compounds containing the chloride, bromide, or iodide anions are soluble    Compounds containing the sulfate anion are soluble, except when paired with group 2 metals    Everything else is insoluble     Exercise 2:      Predict whether the following compounds are soluble or insoluble in water.      Sodium phosphate      Potassium iodide      Silver bromide      Iron (III) carbonate      Magnesium sulfate      Copper (II) sulfate        Classify the following reactions are single replacement or double replacement:                            Will the following reactions produce a precipitate? If so, what is its name and chemical formula?      Aqueous sodium chloride and aqueous copper (II) nitrate      Aqueous sodium hydrogen phosphate and aqueous nickel (II) chloride      Ammonium sulfate and lead (II) nitrate      Strontium bromide and potassium sulfate        Ionic equations and Net Ionic equations   When the reactants in a reaction are aqueous, the standard way of writing a reaction works, but depending on what we’re trying to show, we can sometimes do better. For instance, writing NaCl (aq) in a reaction tells us that sodium chloride is dissolved in water. It doesn’t show us what has happened to the sodium chloride through. When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they dissociate into their ions, with both the cations and anions forming bonds with the dipole of water. A better way of depicting this in a chemical reaction would be to instead write NaCl (aq) as . This is what we do when we write an ionic equation ; all of the reactants and products that are aqueous are instead written as their ions that are dissolved in water. Two important notes:    If there is more than one ion, then this is specified with a coefficient in front of the ion…NOT with a subscript after it.    Polyatomic ions will not break apart    Both of these rules are illustrated when we write as .  A net ionic equation is an ionic equation that only lists the ions that actually react in the reaction. In order to write a net ionic equation we begin with an ionic equation and then delete any ions that are aqueous in both the reactants and products. These ions are called spectator ions because they don’t participate in the reaction themselves. See the example below:  Standard reaction equation:   Ionic equation:   Net ionic equation:    Exercise 3:      Write ionic and net ionic equations for the following reactions                            Key:    E1:        Addition      Decomposition                           E2:        soluble      soluble      insoluble      insoluble      insoluble      soluble        Classify the following reactions are single replacement or double replacement:      Double replacement      Double replacement      Single replacement      Single replacement        Will the following reactions produce a precipitate? If so, what is its name and chemical formula?      No precipitate      yes, nickel (II) hydrogen phosphate ( )      yes lead (II) sulfate,       yes, strontium sulfate,         E3:      Write ionic and net ionic equations for the following reactions      Ionic equation:          Net ionic:        Ionic equation:        Net ionic:        Ionic equation:        Net ionic:        Ionic equation:        Net ionic:     "

  "body": " Reactions 2    Oxidation-Reduction reactions   Another way of classifying reactions is by ones that result in a transfer of electrons from one substance to another, regardless of the number of reactants or products involved. These reactions that involve a transfer of electrons are known as oxidation-reduction reactions (also called redox reactions ). In a redox reaction, one or more reactants will take electrons from one or more other reactants. If a reactant gained electrons then it got reduced . If a reactant loses electrons, then it gets oxidized. This can be remembered by the saying “LeO the lion says GeR”…Losing electrons is oxidation, gaining electrons is reduction. A slight amount of confusion enters in when we talk about oxidizing agents and reducing agents . These agents are causing the oxidation or reduction of some other substance, respectively. Therefore an oxidizing agent will cause the oxidation of something else (ie. cause something else to lose electrons). It can only do this by accepting the electrons itself. Therefore an oxidizing agent gets reduced in a chemical reaction. The opposite is true of reducing agents . A reducing agent causes the reduction of another substance (ie. causes something else to gain electrons) by providing the electrons itself. Therefore reducing agents get oxidized in chemical reactions.  When dealing with ionic compounds in a reaction, it is straightforward to determine if a redox reaction is occurring. All we need to do is look at the charge on the ion. A very important note: elements have a charge of zero when in their elemental form . So in the zinc has a +2 charge and the chlorines each have a charge of zero. Let’s investigate the following reaction:     In this case the zinc begins with a charge of +2. In the products, it is in its elemental form and thus has a charge of zero. How did the zinc change charge??? It gained two electrons! The negative charge of the two electrons cancels out the +2 charge, resulting in neutral zinc. Thus the zinc gained electrons and got reduced. In every redox reaction, something gets reduced and something gets oxidized. So in the example above, what is losing electrons? The chloride has a -1 charge in zinc chloride and still has a -1 charge in sodium chloride, so the chloride isn’t participating in the electron transfer. The sodium, on the other hand, begins in its elemental form with a charge of zero and then has a charge of +1 in the products. So the sodium is losing electrons. Each sodium loses one electron, but there are two sodium atoms present, so this adds up to 2 electrons being lost by the sodiums (which matches the two electrons being gained by the zinc; the number of electrons lost must always equal the number of electrons gained in the reaction).  When gets turned into , hydrogen gas (with its two electrons) is released. Therefore, the reactant got oxidized to . We can recognize this because the carbon in the reactant lost a bond to hydrogen and gained a new bond to oxygen, indicating that it got oxidized. In this reaction the two hydrogen atoms that were lost from gained those two electrons and thus got reduced.      One special class of redox reaction involving covalent compounds is a combustion reaction . In a combustion reaction, a carbon containing compound reacts with oxygen gas ( ), producing carbon dioxide ( ) and water ( ). Combustion reactions are carried out when we burn fossil fuels in our cars or in power plants. The reaction releases a lot of energy that can be harnessed for beneficial purposes. It is also very important to note that our bodies carry out combustion reactions when we break down sugars, fats, and proteins to get harvest energy. The chemical equation showing the breakdown of glucose is shown below:     It is a combustion reaction because a carbon compound reacts with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide and water. Also, the carbon atoms in the glucose compound end up losing bonds to hydrogen and gaining bonds to oxygen, indicating that they are getting oxidized. The oxygen atoms are losing a bond to the other oxygen and gaining new bonds to hydrogen and are thus getting reduced.   Exercise 1:      For the following redox reactions, identify the substance being oxidized and the substance being reduced. Identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent. How many electrons are being transferred in each reaction?                  For the following reactions (note: these are the reactions that you wrote ionic and net ionic equations for in exercise 3…looking at those equations may help you!) identify whether they are redox reactions or not. If they are redox reactions, identify what is being oxidized and what is being reduced.                            In the following redox reactions, identify the species that is getting oxidized and the species that is getting reduced.       A black arrow pointing to a black arrow AI-generated content may be incorrect.       A black arrow pointing to a black arrow AI-generated content may be incorrect.        In the combustion of hexane ( ), one of the reactants is hexane. What are the other reactants and what are the products? (don’t worry about how many of each should be in the reaction)      Which reactant gets oxidized? Which one gets reduced? Which is the oxidizing agent? Which is the reducing agent?        Balancing chemical reactions   In chemical reactions, the law of conservation of mass applies. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed by chemical reactions. The consequence of this law is that when writing chemical reactions, we need to make sure that the number of each type of atom in the reaction is the same on both sides of the reaction arrow. So if there are three nitrogen atoms in the reactants, then the products side must have 3 nitrogen atoms as well. What if the numbers of atoms are not balanced? We cannot change the number of atoms in the compounds without changing the identity of that compound (ie. do NOT change the subscripts). We have to balance the reaction by adding in coefficients in front of the compounds. To do this, we’re going to follow the following steps that will work for any simple reaction (we won’t deal with more complex reaction in this class):    Write the reaction with the correct chemical formulas of the reactants and products    Determine the number of atoms of each element on the reactants and products sides    If all of the elements are balanced, then you’re done      Select one element that appears in only one compound in both the reactants and the products. Balance it by adding in necessary coefficients in front of the compounds. Then check to see if the elements are balanced    Repeat step 3 with other elements that only appear in one compound in both the reactants and product.    Balance any remaining elements by changing\/adding coefficients    Check and recheck every element for balance    Simplify the coefficients    If you have any fractional coefficients, multiply ALL of the coefficients by numbers found in the denominators    If all of the coefficients have a common factor (ex. 4, 8, and 2 all have a common factor of 2), then divide them all by that common factor      To see these steps in practice, see the example below:  Example: Balance the combustion reaction for .    Since this is a combustion reaction, we know the other reactants ( ) and products ( and ) so the reaction is     Check to see if the atoms are balanced on both sides of the reaction:           Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  1    H  4  2    O  2  3      They aren’t, so we have to go to step 3.     We should balance either hydrogen or carbon first because they are only found in one compound in the reactants and products. Oxygen is found in two spots in the products and is thus harder to balance. Lets start with carbon. We need to have two carbons on the right side, so lets as a coefficient of 2 in front of the carbon dioxide as shown:              Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  2    H  4  2    O  2  5     Notice that the number of oxygens in the products also changed…changing coefficients often changes the amount of numerous atoms.    Now that carbon is balanced, let’s balance hydrogen. We need to increase the number of hydrogens on the right side. Adding a coefficient of 2 in front of the water will give us 4 hydrogens since each of the two water molecules has 2 hydrogens:                Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  2    H  4  4    O  2  6       We can now move on to oxygen. There are 6 on the right and 2 on the left. We can fix this by adding a 3 as a coefficient in front of the oxygen gas.              Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  2    H  4  4    O  6  6       All of the elements are balanced and the coefficients are simplified. We are now done.     Exercise 2:      Balance the following reactions by adding in the necessary coefficients:                                Write an equation for the following reactions and balance it    Aqueous sodium sulfate and aqueous calcium chloride are mixed    Combustion of        Moles   In chemistry, we often have to deal with very large numbers of things (ex. atoms or molecules). For convenience, we can rely of scientific notation to help us out. We can also use the term mole to help us out. A mole is a word that represents a number of things (similar to how a dozen means 12 things). The number represented by a mole is Avogadro’s number and has a value of . Why this weird number? You’ll have to wait until the next section of this lesson to find out. We can use the definition of a mole as a conversion factor to convert between numbers of things (atoms\/molecules\/etc.) and moles:       When carrying out calculations involving numbers of molecules and\/or atoms, it is VERY important to add labels to our units to specify what is being quantified. This can help us see if we need to use other conversion factors in our problems. See the example below.  How many molecules are in 3.0 moles of water? How many hydrogen atoms are in 3.0 moles of water?    We begin with 3.0 moles of water and want to determine the number of molecules of water. To do this we need to use Avogadro’s number as shown below:         To convert from molecules of water to number of hydrogen atoms, we need to see that 1 water molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms. This can be written as a conversion factor and used to solve the problem as shown:        Hint to try and understand moles:   When faced with confusing concepts in chemistry, like a mole, it can sometimes be helpful to think of more familiar examples with simpler numbers. Recall that a mole is like a dozen; it is a word that represents a number.  If you have 2 dozen eggs, how many do you have? 24 of course. How did you get that? You took the 2 and multiplied it by the number represented by a dozen (12).  So if you have 2 moles of molecules, you’ll follow the same pattern: 2 times the number represented by a mole (6.022 x 10 23 ).  Likewise if I have 48 eggs, how many dozen do I have? 4 dozen. You get this by taking the number of objects and dividing by the number represented by a dozen.  So…how would you determine how many moles of molecules you have if you have 432 molecules? Take that number and divide it by the number represented by a mole.     How many molecules are in 0.366 moles of carbon dioxide? How many carbon atoms? How many atoms? How many protons?      If you have   hydrogen atoms, then how many moles of atoms do you have. If those hydrogen atoms are in the form of  , then how many molecules of   do you have? How many moles of H 2 molecules do you have?      If 3.0 moles of carbon dioxide are mixed with 4.5 moles of water, how many moles of oxygen atoms are there? How many atoms of oxygen?     Key  Exercise 1:     For the following redox reactions, identify the substance being oxidized and the substance being reduced. Identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent. How many electrons are being transferred in each reaction?      Iron (III) gets reduced and is the oxidizing agent; Cu(I) gets oxidized and is the reducing agent; one electron is transferred from copper (I) to iron (III)      Fluorine gas gets reduced and is the oxidizing agent; iodide ions get oxidized and are the reducing agent; 2 electrons are transferred from two iodide ions to a molecule of fluorine gas        For the following reactions (note: these are the reactions that you wrote ionic and net ionic equations for in exercise 3…looking at those equations may help you!) identify whether they are redox reactions or not. If they are redox reactions, identify what is being oxidized and what is being reduced.      Not redox      Not redox      redox, Cs gets oxidized, Fe(II) gets reduced      redox, Fluorine gas gets reduced, chloride ions get oxidized        In the following redox reactions, identify the species that is getting oxidized and the species that is getting reduced.

  "body": " Reactions 3    Molar Mass and its use in chemistry   We’ve previously learned about atomic mass. Recall that it’s the average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotopes weighted according to their abundance. The value of the atomic mass can be found in the periodic table under the element symbol. By adding together the atomic masses of all of the elements in a compound, we can determine the molecular weight (for covalent compounds) or formula weight (for all compounds) of the compound in units of amu. Molecular weight and formula weight are calculated in the same way, but they apply to different compounds; molecular weight only applies to molecules (which only exist in covalent compounds) whereas formula weight applies to both ionic and covalent compounds. Molar mass is the mass of one mole of the compound. It has the same value as the formula weight and is calculated in the exact same way, but it has different units of grams per mole (g\/mol) instead of amu. Thus a single carbon atom has an atomic mass of 12.011 amu, and a mole of carbon atoms will weigh 12.011 g. This is the reason for the bizarre value of Avogadro’s number…it’s the number of atoms needed to give an atom the same weight in grams as its atomic mass in atomic mass units.  So we can find the molar mass of an element from the periodic table by taking the atomic mass and appending units of g\/mol to it. If we can do this, then we can also figure out the molar mass of entire compounds by simply adding together the molar masses of each of the component elements.   Molar mass is used as a conversion factor to convert between grams and moles and vice-versa. When coupled with Avogadro’s number, we can convert between grams and numbers of things (like molecules). This is summed up in the diagram shown below.   Exercise 1:      What is the molar mass of the following compounds?      Chlorine gas      Magnesium chloride      NaCl      CH 4      Magnesium nitrate        If you have 42.3 g of chlorine gas, how many moles of chlorine gas do you have?      How much does 0.375 moles of NaCl weigh in grams?      How many chlorine atoms are in 5.73 mg of magnesium chloride?      What is the mass of 3.33 x 10 17 hydrogen atoms in nanograms?      Mole-mole relationships in chemical reactions   We just learned how to convert between moles and numbers of atoms\/molecules. When we’re talking about chemical reactions, it is often very useful to be able to convert between moles of one substance in the reaction and moles of another. This allows chemists to determine how much reactant is needed for a reaction to proceed or to determine how much product can be produced. To do these calculations, we NEED to have a balanced chemical reaction. If one is not provided as a part of a question, then you need to make sure to write one.  The balanced chemical reaction is key because the coefficients in front of the chemical formulas will be used to determine a conversion factor called a mole-mole ratio. For instance, the mock formula: implies that for every 2 moles of A, the reaction would require one mole of B and then produce 3 moles of C. We can write these relationships as conversion factors:     Which one we choose is determined by which information we’re given and what information we’re trying to attain. See the example and helpful hint below:  For the reaction below: if we have 3.0 moles of aluminum chloride, then a) how many moles of sodium hydroxide would be needed to completely react with the aluminum chloride and b) assuming that we have an excess of sodium hydroxide, how many moles of aluminum hydroxide could be produced?                 Helpful hint:  It can be helpful to think of more obvious examples of ‘reactions’ that we are familiar with in our everyday lives. The problem solving strategies that you employ can be similarly used in chemistry problem solving. For instance, we all know that a tricycle has 3 wheels. If I have 6 wheels, how many tricycles can I make? The answer is hopefully easy for you to determine…we can make 2 tricycles with 6 wheels. How did you solve this and could you instead use dimensional analysis and a balanced reaction to solve it?  Balanced reaction:   Conversion factor:   Math with the conversion factor:     Write three mole-mole conversion factors based on the reaction shown below:         If you have 17 moles of S 8 , how many moles of oxygen gas are required to completely react with it? If you have that much oxygen gas, then how many moles of sulfur trioxide can you possibly form?    You are carrying out the reaction of iron metal plus chlorine gas to produce iron (III) chloride. If you require 6 moles of iron (III) chloride, how many moles of iron and how many moles of chlorine gas would you need?    Write a balanced chemical equation for this reaction    Figure out the mole-mole conversion factors that you need and solve       Theoretical yield in chemical reactions   In a chemical reaction, it is often surprising to students that the mass of the reactants does not match up with the mass of the products. The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass of all of the reactants must equal the mass of all of the products, but the masses of individual reactants or products often differ. For instance, in the reaction if we start with 2 grams of hydrogen gas (and excess oxygen gas), we don’t get a mass of 2 grams of water; we get about 18 grams of water! Don’t the coefficients from the balanced reaction mean that for every 2 grams of hydrogen gas, we should get 2 grams of water?! No. The coefficients only apply when we’re counting things (numbers of molecules or moles of molecules); they do NOT apply to mass. Why not? The reason is that different molecules have different masses. We can illustrate this with a relatable example:  For the reaction, , if each tire weighs 40 pounds, would you expect the car to weigh only 160 pounds? No. The reason is that the car frame adds mass. The car will have the mass of those tires, but also extra mass from the frame. Similarly, water has added mass from oxygen and thus the 2 grams of hydrogen gas end up producing a larger mass of water.   The previous section allows us to determine the number of moles of product that can be produced in a chemical reaction if we are given the number of moles of reactants. In a laboratory setting, we don’t have any tool that allows us to measure the number of moles of a reactant directly. Instead, we are able to determine the amount of reactants and products by measuring their mass. As we learned in the last lesson, we can easily convert between grams and moles using the molar mass of a substance. So if we are given a certain number of grams of reactant, we can determine the number of moles of that reactant. We can then convert that number of moles to moles of product using the balanced chemical reaction and the mole-mole conversion factor. Finally, we can convert between the number of moles of product and the number of grams of product by using the molar mass of that product. This procedure is summarized in the diagram below:   Exercise 3:      For the reaction shown below, if you have 5.0 grams of S 8 and an unlimited amount of oxygen gas, how many grams of sulfur trioxide could you theoretically form?           For the reaction shown above, how many grams of oxygen gas would be required to react with 5.0 grams of S 8 ?      For the reaction of potassium hydroxide with iron (II) chloride, how many grams of iron (II) hydroxide could form from 3.00 moles of potassium hydroxide and an unlimited amount of iron (II) chloride?      For the reaction in #3, how many grams of iron (II) hydroxide could form from 3.0 grams of potassium hydroxide and an unlimited amount of iron (II) chloride?     Key  Exercise 1:     (your answers may vary depending on the periodic table that you use…you should use all of the digits in the periodic table provided)      70.906 g\/mole      95.211g\/mole      58.433 g\/mole      16.043 g\/mole      148.315 g\/mole        0.597 moles chlorine gas      21.9 g      7.25E19      557 ng     Exercise 2:    Write three mole-mole conversion factors based on the reaction shown below:            If you have 17 moles of S 8 , how many moles of oxygen gas are required to completely react with it?

  "body": " Reactions 4    Reaction energetics: kinetics and thermodynamics   In chemistry, it is often very helpful to know how fast reactions occur. Within our bodies, chemical reactions drive a wide range of different processes ranging from DNA replication, to movement, to nerve firing. Each of these processes must be carefully controlled. For instance, a nerve firing too quickly could disrupt muscle contractions leading to seizures or cardiac arrest. So in chemistry, what controls the speed of a reaction? The answer is that both the speed and extent of a reaction are controlled by the energetics of that reaction. Some reactions that we regard as impossible (ex. helium, a noble gas, reacting with oxygen) aren’t actually impossible…they’d just require a LOT of energy in order to make them occur. Energy similarly controls the speed of a chemical reaction.  How are we to understand the energetics of chemical reactions? Reaction energy diagrams can be very useful in this. A reaction energy diagram displays the energy level of the reactants and products of a reaction as well as the energy of the transition state. The transition state is a point that is midway between reactants and products. In most chemical reactions, bonds have to be broken before new bonds can form. The transition state generally represents a point at which the old bonds have been broken and the atoms are positioned so that new bonds can form (see the figure below that depicts the formation of water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas).  Reaction energy diagrams, like the one shown below, depict the difference between the energy level of the reactants and the transition state, a quantity known as the activation energy of the reaction. Activation energy is directly proportional to the speed or kinetics of a reaction. The higher the activation energy, the slower the reaction; the lower the activation energy, the faster the reaction. This is because as the activation energy of a reaction increases, it becomes less and less probable that a given reactant molecule will have enough energy to transform from reactants into products. The less likely this is, the slower the reaction proceeds. Reactions can be sped up by adding in more energy (ie. by increasing the temperature) or by adding in catalysts . A catalyst is a substance that is able to speed up a reaction by decreasing the energy of the transition state. Importantly, a catalyst does this without being consumed by the reaction. A catalyst also does not affect the energies of the reactants or products.  Reaction energy diagrams also depict the relative energies of the reactants and products. The relationship between the reactants and products will determine which one is favored in the reaction, with nature always favoring the one that has the lowest energy (ie. the one that is the most stable). Reactions where the products are lower in energy than the reactants are called exergonic reactions . These reactions will proceed in the forward direction and will release energy. Reactions where the reactants are lower in energy than the products are called endergonic reactions. In those reactions, the reaction would tend to proceed in the reverse direction, creating more reactants from the products. In order to get the reaction to proceed in the forward direction, energy would have to be put into the reaction, often by applying heat. This is similar to how you have to expend energy to push an object uphill. It is important to understand that whether a reaction is exergonic or endergonic predicts the directionality of a reaction and whether or not there will be more reactants or products when the reaction finishes. It does NOT determine how fast a reaction occurs; that is only determined by the activation energy.   Sample reaction energy diagrams:            Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions in our bodies. Enzymes are not used up in chemical reactions. Thus enzymes are acting as __________ in the chemical reactions that they carryout.    Draw a reaction energy diagram that is exergonic. Label the reactants and products and transition state and mark the activation energy on the diagram.    Draw a second diagram on top of this one that has the same reactants and products but that would occur faster      Draw a reaction energy diagram that is neither exergonic or endergonic. Label the reactants and products and transition state and mark the activation energy on the diagram.    What would you expect the relative amounts of reactants and products to be at the conclusion of this reaction?      Draw a reaction energy diagram where the reactants would almost entirely be converted to products, but where the reaction is also extremely slow.    If we add heat to a reaction, the speed of the reaction will _____________(increase\/decrease)     Reaction equilibrium and Le Chatelier’s principle   Our discussion of reaction energy diagrams and energetics revealed that chemical reactions are reversible. Chemical reactions, once started proceed both in the forward and reverse directions, however it’s often the case that one direction is preferred over the other. For the purposes of this discussion, let’s assume that the forward direction is preferred over the reverse direction (ie. the reaction is exergonic). The net reaction initially proceeds in the forward direction because the forward reaction is occurring faster than the reverse reaction. However, as time goes on, the reactants begin to run out, slowing down the forward reaction, while the reverse reaction begins to speed up. The reaction finally stops once it reaches equilibrium. At this point, the amount of reactants and products is no longer changing because the speed of the forward reaction is equal to the speed of the reverse reaction. Once reactions reach equilibrium, the net reaction can once again proceed (either in the forward or reverse direction) if the equilibrium is disturbed. We can predict the outcome of this disturbance by applying Le Chatelier’s principle . Le Chatelier’s principle states that a reaction at equilibrium will respond to changes by trying to restore the equilibrium. This can be easily illustrated by viewing chemical reactions as a seesaw. A reaction at equilibrium can be thought of as a balanced seesaw; once a disturbance occurs, then the balance of the seesaw is broken. In order to restore the equilibrium, reactants must either convert to products or products must convert to reactants until the balance is once again restored.   Progress of a reaction towards equilibrium :    A useful model for understanding Le Chatelier’s Principle:          For a given chemical reaction, if the forward reaction has a rate of 4 and the reverse reaction has a rate of 6, then what is the direction and net rate of the reaction?      What will happen to the forward and reverse rates as the reaction approaches equilibrium?        Consider the following reaction that has reached equilibrium:         Which direction would you expect the net reaction to proceed in if:      Sodium chloride is added to the reaction      The precipitate is removed from the reaction      The reaction is cooled      The reaction is heated      Sodium hydroxide is added to the reaction      Calcium chloride is added to the reaction        In chemical manufacturing, in order to maximize the amount of product formed, the product is often removed from the reaction as the reaction proceeds.

  "body": " Gases 1    Kinetic molecular theory of gases and pressure   Gases are a state of matter. Gases are similar to liquids in that they adopt the shape of their containers, but are different in that they will spread out to occupy the entire volume of their container. Thus gases do NOT have a fixed volume or a fixed shape. To better understand these properties as well as other properties of gases that we’ll be learning abou in this chapter, scientists have developed the kinetic molecular theory of gases. This theory states that the properties of a gas can be understood by a model that assumes the following:    Gases consist of tiny particles that occupy only a small percentage of the total volume of the gas    The gas molecules are constantly moving with very high speeds    Gas molecules do not interact with one another at all due to their high speeds and the fact that they occupy such a small percentage of the volume of the gas    When gas molecules impact one another or the sides of their container, they bounce off, essentially losing none of their energy.    The average speed of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature. So as temperature increases, the gas molecules move more quickly.    This information about gases will help us to understand other properties of gases as well as the gas laws that we’ll encounter later in the chapter. The first such property that we can begin to discuss is pressure. When a gas is near a surface (like air near our bodies) or trapped in a container, then the gas molecules will impact the surfaces that they’re exposed to with a certain amount of force. This force will push against that surface. When a force is being applied to a surface, we can measure the pressure being exerted. Pressure is simply the amount of force being applied divided by the area of the surface that it’s being applied to. This can be illustrated easily using everyday objects. If you place a large piece of wood on top of another piece of wood and hit it with a hammer, you’re unlikely to drive one piece of wood into the other. However if you place a nail on a piece of wood and hit it with a hammer, you can easily drive the nail into the wood. Why? The amount of force applied with the hammer was the exact same. However, in the first case, the amount of surface that the force was applied to was large, meaning that the pressure was small. In the case of the nail, that same amount of force is applied to the narrow point of a nail (a much smaller area) so the nail has a very high pressure and is able to easily penetrate the wood.  The idea of gas pressure is actually quite fascinating when you think about it. We know that we can inflate balloons by filling them with a gas and that this gas exerts a certain amount of pressure (that we can easily feel if you try and squeeze the balloon). The bizarre thing about the balloon, though, is that the ballon is almost entirely empty. What keeps it inflated isn’t that it is ‘full of air’, it’s that the little bit of air inside is impacting the balloon surface with such force that it’s continually driving it outwards, keeping it inflated. In fact, each gas molecule inside of a helium balloon at room temperature is impacting the surface of the balloon with a speed of approximately 4000 miles per hour!!!  We can measure the pressure of a gas using various units. The SI unit for pressure is a Pascal (Pa), and like other SI units we can attach metric prefixes to it. Other units of pressure are commonly used also. These include atmospheres (atm), bars, inches (or millimeters) of mercury, and pounds per square inch. If you ever need to convert between these various units on an exam, a conversion factor will be provided.   Exercise 1:      If you increase the temperature of a gas      Do the molecules move faster or slower?      Would the molecules impact the sides of the container with more force or less force?      If the sides of the container remain the same size and surface area, would this cause the pressure to increase or decrease?        Calculate the pressure if 10.0 pounds of force are applied to an object with a surface area of 2 square inches (answer in units of pounds per square inch).      Calculate the pressure if 10.0 pounds of force are applied to an object with a surface area of 0.5 square inches (answer in units of pounds per square inch). Is this pressure higher or lower?        Convert 1.72 atm of pressure to the following units using the conversion factors provided:      Pa (1 atm=101,325 Pa)      kPa      pound per square inch (psi) (14.7 psi=1atm)      bar (1 atm=101,325 Pa and 1 bar=100,000 Pa)        Basic gas laws   The kinetic molecular theory of gases can give rise to our understanding of three basic gas laws: Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and Gay-Lussac’s Law. These laws relate changes in pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas. Each law also has an associated equation that can be used to determine the effect of changing the pressure, volume, or temperature of a gas.  Boyle’s law states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional to one another if the temperature is kept constant. This means that as one goes up, the other must go down (ex. if the volume decreases then the pressure must increase). We can understand this quite easily if we reflect on the kinetic molecular theory of gases. If gas molecules are moving around with a certain speed, because the temperature is kept constant, and we shrink the container that the gas is trapped in, then the gas molecules will be impacting the walls of the container more frequently and thus the pressure exerted will increase. Most of us have probably experienced Boyle’s law if you’ve ever tried to squeeze a balloon. When you do that, you are attempting to reduce the volume of the gas, and as you do so, it gets harder and harder to squeeze. Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, this can be described mathematically as where c is a constant (the value of this constant isn’t important and actually varies depending on a number of factors). With that equation, if we increase pressure, then volume must decrease in order for the product to still equal c. This relationship hold true as long and the amount of gas and the temperature are kept constant…so under one set of conditions and under a second set of pressure and volumes . Since both of these equations equal c, we can set them equal to one another to get the equation for Boyle’s law:     This equation can be used to determine the new pressure of a gas if the volume changes or to find the new volume if the pressure changes (again, assuming that the temperature and the amount of the gas are fixed).  Charles’s law relates the volume and temperature of a gas, stating that these two properties are directly proportional (assuming that the pressure and amount of gas are constant). This again agrees with kinetic molecular theory because if I increase the temperature of a gas, the molecules will move faster, this would cause them to impact the sides of the container with more force, thus increasing the pressure. If the pressure is being held constant, however, the only way to allow for this is to have the volume of the gas increase, causing the impacts of the gas on the sides of the container to become less frequent. Thus an increase in temperature causes an increase in volume and a decrease in temperature would cause a decrease in volume. Many of us have also seen Charles’s law in our lives. Charles’s law is used to inflate hot air balloons; the heat from the flame at the base of the balloon heats the gas inside causing the volume of the balloon to increase and inflate. This relationship can be described mathematically by where c is a constant. Like in Boyle’s law, this equation will hold under different conditions, so we can similarly derive the equation for Charle’s law:      It is VERY important to note that this equation only works if the temperatures have units of Kelvin!!!! Using this equation we can predict the new volume of a gas if the temperature changes or the new temperature if the volume changes (assuming that the amount of gas and the pressure are constant)  The final law that we’ll cover in this section is Gay-Lussac’s Law. This law states that pressure and temperature are directly proportional if the volume and amount of gas are fixed. Gay-Lussac’s law can be understood if we realize that increasing the temperature causes the speed of molecules to increase. If the size of the container is kept the same, then those molecules will impact the sides with more force, thus increasing the pressure. Gay-Lussac’s law can be described with the formula:     This equation can be used to find the new pressure if the temperature of a gas changes or the new temperature if the pressure changes (again, assuming that the volume and amount of gas don’t change).   Exercise 2:      Proportionality      For this exercise, we are going to examine an example of inverse proportionality using the equation  , where a and b are the variables that are inversely proportional, and c is a constant. If a= 80 and b=20, then what does c equal?      If a doubles to 160, what is the new value of b (remember that c is the same as in the previous problem because it’s a constant). Does b increase or decrease? Does b decrease by the same amount as a or by the same factor (ie. does it increase by 80 or does it double also)?      If b decreases to ¼ of its original value, then what happens to a? Does a increase by the same amount as b or by the same factor as b?        For this exercise, we are going to examine an example of direct proportionality using the equation  , where a and b are the variables that are directly proportional and c is a constant. If a= 80 and b=20, then what does c equal?      If a doubles to 160, what is the new value of b (remember that c is the same as in the previous problem because it’s a constant). Does b increase or decrease? Does b increase by the same amount as a or by the same factor (ie. does it increase by 80 or does it double also)?      If b decreases to ¼ of its original value, then what happens to a? Does a decrease by the same amount as b or by the same factor as b?          Boyle’s law (for the following problems, assume that the temperature and amount of gas do NOT change)      If a gas has a pressure of 740 kPa and a volume of 23 L, what is the new pressure if the volume is decreased to 17 L?      If a gas has a pressure of 740 kPa and a volume of 23 L, what is the new volume if the pressure is decreased to 110 kPa?      If a gas has a pressure of 740 kPa and a volume of 23 L, what is the new volume if the pressure is decreased to 110 Pa?        Charles’s Law (for the following problems, assume that the pressure and amount of gas do NOT change)      If a gas has a volume of 22.1 L and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new volume of the gas if the temperature is increased to 761K?      If a gas has a volume of 22.1 L and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new temperature of the gas if the volume is increased to 77.1 L      If a gas has a volume of 22.1 L and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new temperature of the gas if the volume is decreased to 77.1 mL?      If a gas has a volume of 73.5 mL at a temperature of 32 o C, then what is the new volume if the temperature decreases to -15 o C.      Calculate this correctly, then calculate it without converting the temperatures to Kelvin. When you leave the temperatures in Celsius, what obvious problem do you notice?          Gay-Lussac’s law (for the following problems, assume that the volume and amount of gas do NOT change)      If a gas has a pressure of 73.2 psi and a temperature of 73.1 o C, what is the new pressure of the gas if the temperature doubles to 146.2 o C?      Did the pressure double when the temperature, measured in Celsius, doubled?        If a gas has a pressure of 73.2 psi and a temperature of 73.1K, what is the new pressure of the gas if the temperature doubles to 146.2 K?      Did the pressure double when the temperature, measured in Kelvin, doubled?        If a gas has a pressure of 2.3 atm and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new temperature of the gas if the pressure is changed to 2.3 kPa (1 atm=101.325 kPa)?

  "body": " Gases 2    Combined gas law   Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, volume and temperature are directly proportional, and pressure and temperature are directly proportional, we can describe these three relationships with the equation . Since this relationship should hold under multiple conditions (assuming that the amount of gas doesn’t change), we can derive the combined gas law:      Exercise 1:      Combined gas law (the following problems assume that the amount of gas doesn’t change)      If a gas has a pressure of 17.0 atm, a volume of 1.05 L and a temperature of 302 K, what is…      the new pressure if the volume is decreased to 0.55 L and the temperature is increased to 331 K?      the new volume if the pressure is increased to 34.0 atm and the temperature decreases to 151 K?      the new temperature if the pressure increases to 33.5 atm and the volume increases to 7.55 L        If a gas has a pressure of 1.52 MPa, a volume of 223 L and a temperature of 151 o C, what is the new temperature if the pressure decreases to 453 kPa and the volume increases to 1.55 kL?        Avogadro’s law and molar volume   All of the gas laws that we learned about in the last lesson allowed for changes in the pressure, volume, and\/or temperature of the gas. All of those laws had the stated assumption that the amount of the gas was fixed. Avogadro’s law is the first law that allows us to predict the effect of changing the amount of gas. Avogadro’s law relates the volume of a gas to the number of moles of the gas. It states that the volume of the gas and the number of moles are directly proportional to one another if pressure and temperature are kept constant. This means that if the number of moles of a gas increase, then the volume would be expected to increase as well. A real-world example of this is what happens when you blow into a balloon. You are increasing the amount of gas in the balloon and, as a result, its volume increases. Like our other gas laws, this proportionality can be shown by an equation: where n is the number of moles of gas and c is a constant. If we want to predict the effect of changing the amount of gas on the volume, then we can use the form of Avogadro’s law shown below:     One consequence of Avogadro’s law is that one mole of a gas will always have the same volume, regardless of which gas we’re talking about, if the pressure and temperature are kept constant. At a standard temperature and pressure (STP, defined as 1 atm of pressure and 273.15 K) one mole of gas has a volume of 22.4 L. This is called the molar volume of a gas. Molar volume can be used as a conversion factor ( ) to convert between volume and number of moles if the gas is at STP conditions.   Exercise 2:      If you have a 22.2 L ballon of gas containing 0.0311 moles of helium, what will the new volume be is an additional 0.0233 moles of helium are added?      If you have a 34.2 L sample of oxygen gas at STP, how many moles of oxygen gas do you have?      What is the volume of 17.0 g of oxygen gas at STP? Hint: what information do we need to go from grams to moles of oxygen gas?      A 10.0L balloon has a contains 3.2 grams of helium gas. If 1.6 grams of helium gas is added, then what is the new volume? Hint: what information do we need to go from grams to moles of helium gas?      Ideal gas law   Avogadro’s law and the other gas laws can all be combined together. Pressure and volume are inversely proportional. Temperature and moles of gas are directly proportional to volume. If we combine all of this information, we get the equation:     where c is a constant. In chemistry, we substitute the symbol R for this constant to give:     R is a special constant in chemistry called the ideal gas constant. There are several different values for R which are all actually equivalent…they have different values because they have different units of pressure or volume. The value of R that uses SI units of pressure and volume is . The equation shown above is called the Ideal Gas Law and is often shown in the rearranged form:     The other laws that we learned about are useful for predicting the effect of changing the conditions of a gas, either the pressure, volume, temperature, or moles of gas. The Ideal Gas Law allows us to calculate one unknown property of a gas if we’re given the other 3 properties. For instance, if we know the pressure, volume, and temperature of a sample of gas, we can calculate the number of moles of gas.  Various values for R:                 If a sample of gas contains 0.0300 moles of gas and has a pressure of 2300 Pa at a temperature of 273K, what would the volume of the gas be?

  "body": " Gases 3    Ideal Gas Law and Chemical Reactions   The Ideal Gas Law can also be used in calculations involving chemical reactions. The Ideal Gas Law can be used to determine the number of moles of reactants or to determine the pressure\/volume\/temperature of the products from the number of moles. This is displayed in the figure below. Also, please see the sample calculation shown below.    A diagram of a chemical process Description automatically generated    Sample calculations:   A vessel with a volume of 1200 L contains 17 kg of nitrogen gas and exactly the amount of hydrogen gas needed to react with it at a temperature of 500.0 o C. The nitrogen and hydrogen gas react according to the equation shown below:       How much hydrogen (in moles) is needed to react with the nitrogen gas?    What is the starting pressure of the gases in the tank in units of psi?    (     What is the pressure in the tank at the conclusion of the reaction in units of psi?     Solutions:     We need to go from kg of nitrogen gas to moles of nitrogen gas using the molar mass, then to moles of hydrogen gas using the mole-mole conversion factor.            We are going to use the Ideal Gas Law and plug in the total number of moles of nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas.               We can borrow information from part a. If we have moles of nitrogen gas, we can use a mole-mole conversion factor to get the number of moles of NH 3 . We can then use the Ideal Gas Law to calculate the pressure.                 Exercise 1:      When our bodies ‘burn’ glucose ( , they do so according to the following reaction:         If a person consumes a soda with 42 g of glucose, what volume of carbon dioxide will they emit at STP once they’ve burned all that glucose?      Water can undergo an electrolysis reaction shown below:         If 33 g of water undergoes this reaction in a sealed chamber with a volume of 2.0 L at a temperature of 301K, then what will the pressure be in the chamber at the end of the reaction in MPa?    Partial Pressures and Dalton’s Law   All of the gas laws that we’ve dealt with thus far assume that we are dealing with a pure sample of one gas. What is we’re dealing with a mixture of gases, like air? If we have a mixture of gases in a container, then we can measure the volume of the mixture and its temperature and those values will apply to each of the individual gases within the mixture as well, because each of the individual gases will occupy the entirety of the volume and have the same amount of kinetic energy as all of the other gases in the mixture. However, the gas particles of an individual gas in a mixture of gases will NOT have the same pressure as the mixture. This is because each individual gas is impacting the sides of the container with only a portion of the total pressure being exerted by the mixture itself. We have a term for the amount of pressure that an individual gas exerts within a mixture and it is called the partial pressure of that gas.   Dalton’s Law deals with the partial pressure of gases within a mixture, and it’s an intuitive law when you think about it. Daltons law says the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases that make up the mixture. This is because each individual gas impacts the sides of the container with a certain force. The total force is simply the sum of the forces of each of the gases. Since they are all impacting the same surface area, the pressures should also be additive. Dalton’s Law is summarized by the following formula:      Exercise 2:      If the partial pressure of gas A is 34 psi and the partial pressure of gas B is 44 psi in the same container, what is the combined pressure of the gases?      If a mixture of gases has a pressure of 4.0 atm, and it contains 3 gases. Gas A has a partial pressure of 2.7 atm, gas B has a partial pressure of 0.4 atm. What is the partial pressure of gas C?      If the chamber has a volume of 3.0 L and the temperature is 298K, then how many moles of each gas are in the chamber? ( )        Water can undergo an electrolysis reaction shown below:         If 33 g of water undergoes this reaction in a sealed chamber with a volume of 2.0 L at a temperature of 301K, then…      What will the partial pressure of hydrogen gas be in the chamber at the end of the reaction in MPa?      What will the partial pressure of oxygen gas be in the chamber at the end of the reaction in MPa?      What is the combined pressure of the gases in the chamber at the end of the reaction in MPa? Use your answers in a and b to answer this. Compare this answer to your answer in Exercise 3 Question 2.     Key:   Exercise 1:      31 L      3.4MPa      Exercise 2:      78 psi      0.9atm      0.33 moles      0.05 moles      0.1 moles          2.3 MPa      1.1 MPa      3.4 MPa       "

  "body": " Gases 4    Henry’s Law and Breathing    Henry’s Law is our last gas law. It deals with solubility. Solubility is the amount of a material that can be dissolved into another; in this case, we’re talking about how much gas can dissolve in water. Henry’s law states that the solubility of a gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure. If the partial pressure of a gas is increased, it can press its way into the liquid more easily, and thus more of that gas dissolves.  Now we’re going to do some practice problems dealing with gas laws and breathing.      Exercise 1:      The lungs inflate and deflate because of the action of a muscle called the diaphragm. This muscle causes the lung volume to expand and contract.      If the volume of the lungs increases, what happens to the air pressure inside of the lungs? Which law dictates this?      If the volume of the lungs decreases, what happens to the air pressure inside of the lungs?      Air will spontaneously move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. For a and b above, which corresponds to inhaling, and which corresponds to exhaling?        In our lungs our cells are exposed to air that has a high partial pressure of oxygen gas. Would the solubility of oxygen in our blood in the lungs be high or low?      When blood travels through our peripheral tissues, the amount of oxygen gas decreases because it gets taken up by our tissues. This __________(decreases\/increases) the partial pressure of oxygen that the blood is exposed to and thus ___________(increases\/decreases) the solubility of oxygen in the blood. Explain how this makes it easier for muscles to obtain oxygen from the bloodstream.      Carbon dioxide is made in our peripheral tissues and is only a small component of our atmosphere. As a result the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is __________(high\/low) in our peripheral tissues, meaning that its solubility in our blood is ______ (high\/low). When blood travels to the lungs, due to the low amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, its partial pressure is ____(high\/low). This _______(increases\/decreases) the solubility of carbon dioxide in the blood, allowing it to be eliminated from the body.      Which Equation do I Need??   Each of the problems that you’ve done thus far is within a single section of the chapter, making it relatively easy to figure out what equation to use. On an exam, the problems are not organized in such a straightforward manner, and it falls on you to figure out which one(s) you need to use. Here are some tips:    In the problem, is something about the gas changing (pressure, volume, moles, temperature)? If so, then you want to use an equation with the subscript 1’s and 2’s…Boyle’s, Charles’s, Gay-Lussac’s, Combined Gas Law, Avogadro’s Law.    Are you trying to find a missing parameter about the gas, but nothing is changing…probably need the Ideal Gas Law.    Is your problem dealing with a reaction or mass of the gas? If so, you probably need to change to moles (using either molar mass or the Ideal Gas Law)    Partial pressures or gas mixtures? Then think Dalton’s Law    Find an equation that has the parameters that are provided and the one that you want. (if you are given a starting pressure and temperature of a gas, and the pressure is changed and you’re being asked for temperature, then Gay-Lussac’s should be used because it has only pressure and temperature in the equation)     Exercise 2:      If you have 2.0 grams of argon gas in a 25L balloon, what will the new volume be if 3.0 grams of argon gas is added. Assume that the temperature and pressure do NOT change.      If a gas has a pressure of 2.1 atm and a volume of 3.3 L, what will the new pressure be if the volume is expanded to 5.7 L?      A gas at 271 K, 3.3 atm of pressure, and with a volume of 5.4 L is heated to 299K at the same time that its volume is decrease to 1.7 L. What is the new pressure?      3.5 grams of gaseous water vapor is at a temperature of 452K in a volume of 150mL. What is the pressure of this gas in MPa?      2.5 moles of gas A completely reacts to form gases B and C according to the reaction below. The reaction takes place in a 15L vessel at 522K.           What is the pressure in units of Pa at the beginning of the reaction in MPa?      What is the partial pressure of B in the vessel at the end of the reaction in MPa?      What is the total pressure in the vessel at the end of the reaction in MPa?     Key:   Exercise 1:        Pressure decreases, Boyle’s law      Pressure increases, Boyle’s law      A is inhaling, B is exhaling        High solubility of oxygen      Decreases, decreases. Since the blood has a lower solubility of oxygen due to Henry’s Law, this causes even more oxygen to leave the blood for the tissues to use, ultimately removing almost all of the oxygen from the blood for use by tissues in the body.      High, high, low, decreases      Exercise 2:      63 L      1.2 atm      12 atm      4.9 MPa        0.72 MPa      0.36 MPa      1.4 MPa       "

  "body": " What are acids and bases?   Summary:     Acids donate ions to other things and increase the amount of in a solution    Bases accept ions and increase the amount of in a solution     What are acids and bases?   There are multiple definitions of acids and bases which all generally say the same things, but with different ways of looking at it. These definitions are summarized in the table below:         Name  Definition of an acid  Definition of a base    Arrhenius definition  Produces H +  Produces OH -    Brønstead-Lowry definition  Donates H +  Accepts H +     Compounds like HCl are acids because they are ionic compounds and when we place them into water, the ions will dissociate producing H + and Cl - . Because HCl produces H + in water, it fits the definition of an Arrhenius acid. However, H + doesn’t exist for very long in water. It rapidly reacts with water to produce hydronium ion , H 3 O + . Thus the HCl actually donated an H + to water in this reaction, fitting the Brønstead-Lowry definition of an acid             A lone pair of electrons on water forms a covalent bond with a ion to form a hydronium ion.   Sodium hydroxide fits the definition of a base. When it is dissolved in water, it quickly dissociates into ions, Na + and OH - . As a result, it fits the definition of an Arrhenius base since the concentration of hydroxide increases. It also fits the definition of a Brønstead-Lowry base, but this takes a bit more effort to see. This is because the hydroxide that is produced can accept a H + forming water.           Acids and bases don’t just react with water, they can be mixed allowing them to react with one another. In these cases, often the Brønstead-Lowry definition is easier to use to identify an acid from a base. Consider the reaction shown below:     In this reaction, the NH 3 (ammonia) accepts an H + from CH 3 CO 2 H (acetic acid). Thus ammonia is acting as a base and acetic acid is an acid because it donates an H + .  What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH 4 not an acid while HCl is? Hold that question for now. It will be discussed more in the conjugate acids and bases section later in this lesson.  "

  "body": " Naming acids and bases   Summary:     Acid naming rules    Bases naming rules     Naming acids and bases   We already know how to name the common bases that we’ll see in this chapter. Most of the bases we’ll be discussing are ionic compounds that contain the hydroxide ion. We’ll be naming those compounds in the same way that we’ve named them in the past. There is one additional base that we’ll frequently encounter in this chapter, NH 3 , which is called ammonia (you should learn this). We’ll learn about other nitrogen containing bases in later chapters as well as how to name them.  Naming acids follows different rules than we’ve used previously. When naming acids, it depends on if the acid is 1) composed of two elements, 2) contains a polyatomic ion, or 3) is an organic acid (more on these in a later chapter). Acids that contain only two elements include HCl, HBr, and HI. For these acids, we name them by starting with the name of the anion (ex. HCl—we start with chloride). We then drop the -ide ending and replace it with “-ic acid”. Lastly we add “hydro-“ as a prefix. So, HCl is hydrochloric acid.  If the acid contains a polyatomic ion, then we name the anion and drop the -ate ending from the name (we won’t worry about polyatomic ions with other endings). We then add on “ic-acid” and in some cases instead add “-uric acid” or “-oric acid” (if the name of the polyatomic ion ends in an “f” sound; ex. -fate or -phate).  Additionally, some acids are polyprotic acids, meaning that they have more than one H+ that can be donated to a base. Phosphoric acid, for example, is the acid produced from the phosphate ion, . The acid thus must have 3 H + added to fully neutralize the 3 - charge, giving the formula H 3 PO 4 . Previously, we learned that there are other forms of the phosphate anion that has one or two H + s added on. and are called hydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate respectively. These are also acids since they have one or more H + s to donate, but since they are also polyatomic ions, their name is simply the name of the polyatomic ion.  To figure out the formula for an acid, we need to know the anion that it is paired with, both its formula and its charge. We then only need to pair it with the appropriate number of H + ions in order to have the number of positive and negative charges be equal.  "

Strengths of acids and bases   When an acid or base is dissolved into water, the compound dissociates into ions (or produces ions in other cases). This process can be written as a chemical reaction. See the example below:     In a previous chapter, we learned that all chemical reactions are reversible and we learned about equilibrium. The same is true for the dissociation of an acid or base in water. Some of these dissociation reactions have equilibriums that lie so far towards the products that they are nearly irreversible reactions. When these acids\/bases dissolve into water, they very nearly completely dissociate into their ions. These compounds are said to be strong acids and strong bases. There is a list of strong acids and strong bases that you need to memorize:  Strong acids: .  Strong bases: group I and II metals paired with hydroxide in an ionic compound (ex. NaOH)   Weak acids and weak bases are ones where the compound dissociates into ions when put into water, but not completely. There is still a measurable amount of the starting compound left over. This is because the reverse reaction still occurs to an appreciable extent. These weak acids and bases partially dissociate into ions when dissolved. Thankfully there is no list of weak acids\/bases that you need to memorize. All you need to know is that if you’re dealing with an acid or base that isn’t a strong acid or base, that it will be a weak one instead.  "

  "body": " Conjugate acid \/ base pairs   Summary:     Acids become conjugate bases after they lose a hydrogen ion    Bases become conjugate acids after gaining a hydrogen ion    Conjugate acid \/ base pairs are compounds (or ions) that are related by the addition\/removal of a single ion.     Conjugate acid \/ base pairs   The dissociation of an acid or base is a reversible reaction (excepting strong acids and bases). If acetic acid functions as an acid, donating its H + to something else, then acetate results as a product. In the reverse reaction, that acetate ion would accept an H + once again becoming acetic acid. Thus acetate would be functioning as a base. Every acid produces a base after donating its H + . Likewise, every base produces an acid after accepting an H + , because the reverse reaction would have the product donating the H + that the base form had just received.  Every acid will therefore form a base in a chemical reaction. This is called the conjugate base of that acid. Together they form a conjugate acid-base pair , two molecules whose only difference is the presence or absence of an H + . Likewise every base will form a conjugate acid after accepting an H + in a reaction, and they together for a conjugate acid-base pair.  What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH 4 not an acid while HCl is? The truth is that every compound with a hydrogen atom is potentially an acid, but some of them are so weak that we don’t consider them to be an acid (CH 4 is an example of this). The strength of an acid is related to the stability of its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is very stable, then it is easy for the acid to lose an H + and form its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is an anion that we’ve seen before (monoatomic or polyatomic), then it’s stable. In the case of , its conjugate base would be . This is unstable because it would put a negative charge on a carbon atom, something we’ve never seen before (reminder: carbon isn’t very electronegative and thus wouldn’t like to have excess electrons). Negative charges can exist on highly electronegative elements such as the halogens and oxygen. If a molecule has a positive charge and has a hydrogen atom, it can often act as an acid since losing the H + can stabilize the molecule by also removing the positive charge (ex.   In order for a molecule to act as a base, the molecule must have a lone pair of electrons in order to form a new bond with the H + that it would accept. In addition, the conjugate acid must be stable. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms often have lone pairs of electrons and are especially good at accepting H + . Also, molecules that have a negative charge and lone pairs of electrons are often good bases because if they accept an H + , the negative charge will get neutralized (ex. ).  "

  "title": "Water",
  "body": " Water   Summary:     Water can act as an acid or a base in a reaction    There is a relationship between the amount of hydronium and hydroxide ions in an aqueous solution    We can use the Kw equation to determine the concentration of hydroxide and hydronium ions in a solution     Water can be an acid or a base   We already learned that acids donate H + or increase the concentration of H + in solution. This is a bit of an oversimplification. In water, H + essentially doesn’t exist, because it very rapidly undergoes a reaction with water that is shown below:     H 3 O + is a polyatomic ion called hydronium ion . Chemists will typically use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably, so just be aware that H + really means H 3 O + if the acid is in water. Another term to be aware of is that H + is sometimes called a “proton”. Why? Well most hydrogen atoms have 1 proton, no neutrons, and 1 electron…take away the electron to form H + and all you have leftover is 1 proton.  We’ve discussed the definition of an acid and a base and have seen examples of what happens when acids or bases are mixed with water. In this section, we’re going to have a bit more formal treatment of what happens when an acid or base is mixed with water. See the chart below:          What is being mixed with water  Water acts as a…  Water becomes…  Example reaction    Acid (Strong or weak)  Base  Hydronium ion     Strong Base  Acid  Hydroxide ion     Weak Base  Acid  Hydroxide ion       Note: when nitrogen containing bases are mixed with water, the product is a salt with hydroxide. The base accepts a proton from water and forms an ionic compound with the leftover hydroxide as shown in the table above and the additional reactions below:      So nitrogen containing bases that are aqueous can be written as salts with hydroxide. However, they are weak bases so the reactant form also remains. Either form is appropriate to write as shown in the table below:         Nitrogen containing base examples  Form 1  Form 2                    Since water can act both as an acid and a base, we can write the following reaction where one water is an acid and another is a base. This reaction is continually happening in a sample of liquid water:     So in a sample of water, there is always some hydronium ion and some hydroxide ion. If water is neutral (ie. not acidic or basic), then the concentration of hydroxide and hydronium ions are equal. If water is acidic (for instance, if an acid is added to water), then extra hydronium ion has been produced and the amount of hydronium ion exceeds the amount of hydroxide ion. If the water is basic, (for instance, if a base is added to water), then extra hydroxide ions have been produced and the amount of hydroxide exceeds the amount of hydronium ions. There is an inverse relationship between the amount of hydroxide and hydronium ions in solution. If we multiply their concentrations (measured in molarity), we get a constant, K w , which has a value of 1x10 -14 at 25 o C. This is shown by the equation below. In the equation, the brackets indicate that these are the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide, measured in molarity. Note: it is crucial that you use the concentrations in molarity and not any other unit for this calculation. K w is a unitless value (even though it seems like it should have units of M 2 ) but the reason why is beyond the scope of this course.     This equation can be used to find the concentration of hydroxide or hydronium ion, if we’re given the concentration of the other one. It can also be used to find the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions in a neutral solution as shown below:  Since it’s neutral,   Therefore, becomes   So   "

Ionic equations can be used to represent neutalization reactions     Neutralization reactions for monoprotic acids and bases   The other class of reaction that we’ve seen before in this chapter is a neutralization reaction. Here we’ll cover it in more detail. If the neutralization reaction is between a strong acid and strong base, then the products will be water and a salt as shown in the equations below:  Chemical equation:     Ionic equation:     Net ionic equation:     Any neutralization reaction involving a strong acid reacting with a strong base will have an ionic equation of:       Steps to writing a neutralization reaction     Break the reactants into their ions     is a covalent compound and thus won’t break apart into ions. There is no hydroxide it can lose.      Identify the acid and the base    When identifying the acid and the base, H + will always be an acid and OH - will always be a base (in your class, at least)    If the acid is a polyatomic ion (ie. one of the polyatomic ions with “hydrogen” in the name, then break off the hydrogen ion (example: breaks into and ))      React the acid and the base. H + and OH - will combine together (if present) to form water, but in some cases the base may be something other than hydroxide. In those cases, have the hydrogen ion react with whatever other base is present.    Look at what ions you have left over (and what new ion you may have formed)    Write these ions in the products (if you’re being asked for an ionic equation)    Delete any ions that didn’t change in the reaction (if you’re being asked for a net ionic equation)    Combine the ions together to form an ionic compound (if you’re being asked for the chemical equation)       To write a neutralization reaction, like we just did above, we first split acid and base into their ions. Then we allowed the acid (H + ) to react with the base (OH - ) to form water. This results in ions being left over (the spectator ions). Those ions are    Combined together to form the chemical equation,    Left alone as separate ions (to form the ionic equation), or    Deleted in both the reactants and products to form the net ionic equation    Neutralization reactions can follow slightly different patterns when the base is NOT hydroxide. For instance, if the base is ammonia ( ), then we need to first recognize that this is a covalent compound, not an ionic compound. Thus it won’t split into ions in the first step. See the example below:   If we react with , after step one, we’d have . At this point the acidic ion will react with the basic to form . The product would then contain and the left over We can then write the equation in the following ways:  Ionic equation:     Net ionic equation (get rid of the chloride spectator ion):     Chemical equation (combine the ions in the products together to make a compound):      As a final nuance, we can also have cases where polyatomic ions can act as acids. In those cases, the polyatomic ion will have “hydrogen” as a part of its name. This hydrogen will be lost to the base. Therefore, this polyatomic ion must be broken apart by losing its H + . See the example below:   If we react with , after step one, we’d have . In step 2, the HCl is identified as the acid since it has an H + ion; therefore the sodium dihydrogen phosphate must be the base. At this point the acidic ion will react with the basic to form .

Calculations involving pH involve logarithms\/power functions     pH   When scientists describe how acidic or basic a solution is, we could report the concentration of hydronium ion or hydroxide ion. However, because the numbers are so small and usually written in scientific notation, this becomes quite cumbersome. To solve this problem, we instead often transform the concentration of hydronium ion into a pH value using the formula below:     This version of the equation can be used to find the pH value from a concentration of hydronium ion (which MUST be molarity). We can figure out the pH of a neutral solution as shown:     pH values lower than 7 are said to be acidic solutions. pH values above 7 are basic solutions. The reason why will be determined as a part of your exercises.   The pH scale    In some cases, we’ll need to figure out the concentration of hydronium ion from a pH value. This requires rearrangement of the pH equation using algebra skills. The tricky part of this is that we need to ‘undo’ the log function. This is done by taking 10 and raising it to the power of everything on that side of the equation as shown below:                 If the concentration of hydronium ion is 0.0044M, calculate the pH of the solution      2.4        If the concentration of hydroxide ion is 0.0044M, calculate the pH of the solution.    Use the Kw equation to find the hydronium ion concentration first.    11.6        If the pH of a solution is 4.3, calculate the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration. Which is greater?    Use the reverse pH equation to get the hydronium ion concentration. You can then get the hydroxide concentration using the Kw equation.    [hydronium]= , [hydroxide]= , hydronium ion concentration is higher        Repeat the same calculations, but at a pH value of 9.2.      [hydronium]= , [hydroxide]= , hydroxide ion concentration is higher        Compare the results of the last two problems. If the pH is greater than 7, is the hydronium or hydroxide ion concentration bigger? What about below pH 7?      The hydronium ion concentration is greater than the hydroxide ion concentration below pH 7. Above pH 7, the reverse is true.              If 1.00 g of HCl is added to 2.0 L water, what is the new pH?     Step 1: How many moles of HCl was added? How many moles of hydronium was added?

  "body": " Buffers   Summary:     Buffers help solutions resist changes in pH    Buffers are mixtures of weak acids and weak bases    Every buffered solution has a buffering capacity that describes how much acid or base it can handle     Buffers    Buffers are substances that can be added to water to make the water resistant to changes in pH. A buffer consists of either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. How does this mixture of substances make the solution more resistant to changes in pH?  When a strong acid is added to water, it will form hydronium ions and the concentration of the hydronium ions formed will be the same as the concentration of the acid that was just added, because a strong acid completely dissociates upon addition to water. Likewise if a strong base is added to water, it will form the number of hydroxide ions that are contained in that substance that was added, again because a strong base will completely dissociate when added to water. The additional hydronium ion or hydroxide ion will then directly affect the pH of the solution.  When a buffer is present, the solution contains an additional solute that is an acid and another that is a base. These acids and bases are capable of reacting with any base or acid that might get added to the solution, helping to neutralize it. The picture below might help.   How a buffer resists changes in pH from the addition of acid    Every buffer has a buffering capacity . This is the amount of additional acid or base that can be added without exceeding the amount of buffering compounds. So if a buffered solution contains 0.1M weak base and 0.2M of its conjugate acid, then the solution could handle the addition of up to 0.1M hydronium ions before running out of weak base (because the weak base will react with the hydronium ions) and up to 0.2M hydroxide ions (because the hydroxide would react with the conjugate acid). Amounts of hydronium above 0.1M would exceed the buffering capacity of the solution as would addition of more than 0.2M hydroxide ion.     Which of the following mixtures of chemicals would make good buffers?          Yes        \/      Yes             No    They are related by the addition\/removal of a proton. However, hydroxide is a strong base, not a weak base.           Yes             No    These compounds are related by the addition\/removal of a proton. However, HCl is a strong acid.      \/      Yes             No    These compounds are both weak acids. Neither is a base. Also neither has its conjugate base present.       Create a drawing similar to the figure above that shows how a buffer can resist changes to pH caused by adding in strong base.             If a solution contains 0.11 moles of weak base and 0.34 moles of weak acid, then ...     How many moles of nitric acid could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      0.11 moles        How many moles of sodium hydroxide could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      0.34 moles        How many moles of calcium hydroxide could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      0.17 moles        "

  "body": " Acid-base titrations   Summary:     Titrations are reactions used to determine the concentration of an unknown.    Mole-mole conversion factors from the balanced neutralization reaction     Acid-base titrations   An acid base titration is simply a solution reaction that is used to measure the concentration of an acid or base. If we begin with a known volume of solution with an unknown concentration of acid, we can determine its concentration by measuring the number of moles of base that we have to add to neutralize it. The easiest way to do that is to slowly add a solution of base of known concentration to the solution using a burette, which allows us to measure the volume of base needed. If we have the volume and concentration of the base, we can use this to determine the number of moles of base. From there, we can convert moles of base to moles of acid using the balanced chemical equation. If we know moles of acid and its volume (remember we need to know this when we start the titration), then we can divide them to determine the concentration.  Up to this point, the acid-base neutralization equations that we’ve been working with have had a 1:1 ratio of acid to base. With some acids and bases, this ratio may not be 1:1. Consider calcium hydroxide, . Each unit of calcium hydroxide contains 2 hydroxide ions. Each one of these bases must be neutralized by a separate hydrogen ion from the acid. Thus 2 acidic ions will be required to neutralize one calcium hydroxide. As with any stoichiometric calculation, we must ensure that we have a balanced equation first to give us the proper mole-mole ratios for our calculations.     7.50 mL of an HCl solution was neutralized by the addition of 14.30mL of 0.0980 M NaOH.

  "body": " Definitions   Chapter 1      Natural world: Everything that comprises our universe. The natural world are those things that we can see and touch. The natural world can be explored through science.         Supernatural: Those things that are outside of nature or the laws of physics. We can learn about supernatural things by logical reasoning, philosophy, and theology.         Potency: Potency is the potential to change in some specific way. Natural things have the potency of motion. They aren’t necessarily moving initially, but after the potential of motion is actualized by something else, the thing is now moving.         Actuality: Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. For instance, a spark has the ability to cause a paper to start on fire. The spark possesses the property of being able to actualize the fire. The paper possesses the potency of burning.         Actus Purus: Actus Purus means pure actuality. It is something that possesses the property of actuality without any potency. Actus Purus can cause change in other things but cannot be changed itself.         Holistic: emphasizing the whole and showing concern about each of the component parts of a thing.         Science: a method for systematically studying the observable world.         Scientific method: A process that allows us to develop explanations for the observations about the natural world. The core steps are observe, hypothesize, and experiment.         Laws: statements that express a repeated pattern of behavior in nature. Laws do NOT seek to explain the cause of the behavior.         Hypothesis: A statement that seeks to explain observations of nature.         Variables: The parameter or condition that is changed within an experiment.         Control groups: The groups within an experiment where the variable is unchanged. Positive controls attempt to cause the behavior to ensure that it can be observed. Negative controls often withhold the variable to allow for observation of what the behavior is in the absence of the variable.         Experimental groups: Experimental groups include the variable and often involve changing it in some way (ex. amount of the variable, exposure time to the variable, etc.).         Theory: A hypothesis that has substantial experimental support. Theories can never be proven. They can be supported to greater and greater degrees, but they can never reach absolute certainty.         Correlation: Correlation is when we observe a pattern or relationship between changing a variable and the observed response. For instance, if increasing the amount of an antibiotic leads to greater observation of bacterial cell death, we’d say that the antibiotic amount correlates with bacterial cell death.         Deify: Deify means to treat something like a God. In this case, I mean that science has begun to replace God in the minds of many people in today’s society. People look to science for solutions to all of their problems. People also look to science to find explanations about humanity’s purpose and dignity (or lack thereof) within the context of nature.         Consensus: A consensus is a general belief amongst scientists that a particular theory is true. This is arrived at by comparing the quality of experiments and their conclusions throughout the scientific community as well as the number of studies that support a particular conclusion.         Bias: A preference that prevents fair judgment.         Engineering: Engineering seeks to solve problems by creating solutions. It relies of science to explain how things work so that engineering can figure out how to use them to solve a problem.         Politics: Politics is not a major focus of this course. However, politics is related to science an engineering because politics should seek the welfare of the people in society. Politics can encourage the use of engineering to solve problems and can encourage scientific discovery, both of which can be used for political goals.         Activists: One who tries to influence public opinion. Scientists can potentially do this in ethical ways or unethical ways.         Chemistry: Chemistry studies the properties of matter. This includes how matter interacts with energy, how matter is structures, how matter behaves in a variety of conditions, etc.         Matter: Matter is difficult to define exactly. Our definition is that matter must have mass and occupy space. It is essentially the “stuff” that is in the universe.         Mass: Mass is difficult to define in physics. If something has inertia (the ability to resist changes in movement) or exerts gravitational attraction to other objects, then that object has mass. Mass can be quantified to determine the extent to which an object has inertia or can exhibit gravitational attraction.       Chapter 2      Numerator: the top of a fraction.         Denominator: the bottom of a fraction.         Dividend: the number that is being divided.         Divisor: the number of parts that the dividend is being divided into.         Coefficient: the leading part of scientific notation. It should always be a number between 1 and 10 and should be written as a decimal.         Base: follows the coefficient in scientific notation. The coefficient is multiplied by the base. The base is always 10 raised to some integer power.         Exact number: a value that is countable, a definition, or a desired quantity. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures.         Measured number: a value that was measured and thus isn't known exactly. Every measured number has a non-zero amount of uncertainty.         Significant figures: the digits in a number that both convey its quantity and that are known reliably.       Chapter 3    Chapter 4    Chapter 5    Chapter 6    Chapter 7    Chapter 8    Chapter 9    Chapter 10      Hydronium ion: A cation that forms when acids react with water. It has the formula          Buffer: Substances that can be added to water that help the solution resist changes in pH. Buffers are mixtures of weak acids and their conjugate base.         Buffering capacity: The amount of strong acid or strong base that a buffer can neutralize.         Titration: The process of using a chemical reaction to figure out the concentration or amount of an unknown sample.      "
