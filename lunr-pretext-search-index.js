  "title": "Purpose",
  "body": "Purpose  This textbook is intended for collegiate pre-nursing students as a part of a two semester course in General, Organic, and Biological chemistry. The first ten chapters of this text is also appropriate for high school students as a first chemistry course and pairs with the Franciscan Advantage program in chemistry that is offered by Franciscan University of Steubenville.  I believe that this textbook is unique in that it pairs active-learning in chemistry with a Catholic-Christian understanding of science and chemistry. Active learning is an educational term that encompasses many different approaches, but importantly means that the student is actively engaged in learning rather than listening to lectures.  This textbook is divided into chapters. Each chapter is further divided into lessons (which are appropriate for a 50 min college class or perhaps several days worth of a high school class). Within each lesson are several sections, each of which teaches a different concept. The sections contain a text lesson, which should ideally be read by the student before class. Each section ends with several exercises which are designed to be completed during class, with the help of peers or the instructor. Studies have repeatedly shown that students learn better and retain knowledge better when they are actively engaged in learning new material rather than simply having it presented to them.  This text also aims to incorporate a Catholic-Christian understanding of science, philosophy, and ethics. The first chapter of the textbook focuses heavily on this, but there are additional places throughout the textbook where the relevance of the lesson to our faith and morals is discussed further.  To further aid in student learning, this textbook includes helpful online video instruction to accompany the various chapters and lessons in the textbook. These videos are freely available on YouTube, and teachers and students are encouraged to utilize them where they deem appropriate.  "

  "title": "Learning in an Active Classroom",
  "body": "Learning in an Active Classroom  This textbook is designed for use in an Active Learning environment. This may be different than other classes that you’re used to taking in that there is substantially less lecturing from your instructor and more emphasis on you learning by actively participating in the learning process. This requires that you listen and take notes when your instructor is teaching, just as you would in any class. Even more important, though, is that you complete all of the exercises in this text. These should be completed before you go on to the next section, since much of science builds upon prior knowledge and skills.  When completing the exercises, you should be aware of the following guidelines:   Always WRITE down your responses to each question and include any work. If you struggled with this problem, your work should include notes to help you remember how you solved the problem. Writing helps you commit your responses to memory and provides an invaluable study aid for quizzes and\/or exams.    If you are struggling with a problem, first ask your group for help. If your group cannot solve the problem, ask your instructor for help. Reaching out for help is an essential skill in an active learning environment and throughout life!    Always make sure to check your answer with the key in the textbook. Everyone makes mistakes! The only way to correct them is to know that you made a mistake in the first place.    If you get help, write down notes about the help you receive!    Do not skip or ignore any exercise problem. They are all there for a reason!    Don’t be afraid to struggle! There’s no shame in not understanding something. The real failure is if you give up.     In an active learning classroom group work is highly encouraged. Not only does it give you an opportunity to help others, but it strengthens learning by requiring you to be able to explain the concepts that you’re learning about. Also, if you are the one who is having to ask the questions, forming fraternal bonds with your classmates can help you through your struggles in a class and ensure that you always have multiple sources of help available to you. On the other hand, if you’re the one explaining a concept to a fellow group member, make sure that they understand what you are saying and be patient with them if they continue to struggle. It’s all too common to have a student respond “Oh I get it now” when they don’t fully grasp what you said. Don’t be afraid to struggle!  Group work can have pitfalls if you don’t utilize it properly. It’s the responsibility of each member of the group to contribute to the exercises, to ensure that they understand the material being covered, and to ensure that their fellow group members understand the material. If you don’t understand a concept, keep asking for help until you do. Don’t just rush through the exercises and assume that because the group got the answers right that you also understand the concept or how to solve the problem. Again, don’t be afraid to struggle!   Exercise: Learning in an active classroom     Write down the 6 guidelines to completing exercises in an active classroom. Why is each one of these guidelines important?    Introduce yourself to your group members (no need to write anything down for this one, unless you want to). Suggested information includes your name, hometown, major, hobbies, etc. You may find yourself in a different group from time-to-time. Always take time to introduce yourself to people who are new to you and to learn about them as well. If you’re completing this course on your own (ex. in a homeschool environment), make sure to find someone knowledgeable in chemistry who you can reach out to. Also you can always reach out to the author, Dr. James Vranish, by emailing him at jvranish@franciscan.edu .      "

  "body": " Chemistry and Faith   Summary:     Relationship between the natural and the supernatural    What is meant by the natural and supernatural    The existence of the natural world is dependent on a supernatural cause    Christians hold the natural and supernatural to both be important      The greatest commandment    Love God and love your neighbor as yourself    In order to holistically love our neighbor, we must care for their natural and supernatural needs       Section 1: Natural and the Supernatural   In this textbook, I’m going to be assuming that the reader acknowledges the existence of the Christian God and His Son, Jesus Christ. My discussions of faith, science, and ethics will come from the theological tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, but will have a lot in common with other Christian denominations. If there are areas in the text that seem to be at odd with your own personal beliefs, I hope the information contained in here can serve as a starting point for further discussions and debates.  Catholics acknowledge Jesus and thus can’t separate their discussions of the natural world  Everything that comprises our universe. The natural world are those things that we can see and touch. The natural world can be explored through science. from the supernatural  Those things that are outside of nature or the laws of physics. We can learn about supernatural things by logical reasoning, philosophy, and theology. (bolded text is usually indicating an important term that you SHOULD know the definition of. In this textbook, definitions and extra commentary are provided as footnotes at the bottom of the page). Both the natural and supernatural are components of reality and are interdependent. Catholics acknowledge the existence of God, and thus existence that is beyond nature, in other words, the supernatural. As St. Thomas Aquinas argues in his Summa Theologica , the creation of the natural world presupposes a supernatural cause; nature cannot be the first cause. He argues this at length through the “first mover” argument. In this argument he establishes that the natural world is dependent on God for its existence. This argument goes something like this:    The natural world is full of motion. Matter moves, time moves, etc.    All motion must have a prior cause.    Natural things have the potential to move, that is they have potency  Potency is the potential to change in some specific way. Natural things have the potency of motion. They aren’t necessarily moving initially, but after the potential of motion is actualized by something else, the thing is now moving. . That potential can be realized through the action of some outside cause. Natural things also have actuality  Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. For instance, a spark has the ability to cause a paper to start on fire. The spark possesses the property of being able to actualize the fire. The paper possesses the potency of burning. , the ability to bring forth potency (ie. natural things can cause other natural things to move). The bringing forth of potency is a change in that thing.    There must be a first actuality to bring forth all motion. That actuality can’t have potency, otherwise it would have had to be acted on by something else first. We can summarize this by saying that there must be a “first mover”.    There is a philosophical need for an actor that can actualize motion but remain unchangeable. We call this actor God. God must therefore lack potency (He doesn’t change). Instead, God is pure actuality ( Actus Purus  Actus Purus means pure actuality. It is something that possesses the property of actuality without any potency. Actus Purus can cause change in other things but cannot be changed itself. ). He can initiate change or motion but can’t be acted upon or changed by other things.    Actus purus must initiate all motion. Therefore God must have initiate all of nature.    After having established the existence of the supernatural in addition to the natural world, many questions arise about the importance of each and the relationship between them (example: miracles). In many ways, the Catholic faith is grounded in the supernatural. God has a supernatural nature and is both the Creator and Redeemer. Humanity is dependent on Him for existence, and the hope for eternal life rests solely in Him. Because of the supremacy of God’s supernatural nature, one might argue that the best thing that each of us can do with our lives is to put all of effort into understanding the supernatural, thus minimizing the importance of the material world. Indeed portions of scripture could be interpreted as saying that this is the approach that Catholics should take. Two examples:   “Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” 1 John 2:15   “’Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?  Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?  Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?  Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.  But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.  If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?  So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’  All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.  But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.” Matthew 6: 25-33.  So, should we all study theology and scorn the study of the natural world? Hopefully it is obvious to you that this view is incomplete and thus misguided…but why?   Exercise 1: Natural and the Supernatural     Summarize the first mover argument in your own words.    Explain the terms potency, actuality, and Actus Purus in your own words. What is the relationship between the three terms?    Would most superheroes be best classified as natural or supernatural? They are clearly exceptional, but are they supernatural?    Are angels natural or supernatural? Do angels possess potency, actuality, or both?    Is everything that is supernatural Actus Purus?    As Catholics, we believe that God is not exclusively supernatural. We believe that Jesus is the unity of the supernatural and the natural in one person. How does this knowledge inform the way in which we should approach the relationship between the natural and the supernatural as Catholics? Is one more important than the other?    Catholics are called to be separate from the world, yet we are material creatures. What are ways in which we can practically abandon materialism?     Section 2: The Greatest Commandment   In scripture, Jesus gives us the Greatest Commandment:   “[Jesus] said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.  This is the greatest and the first commandment.  The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” Matthew 22:37-39  Each of us lives and acts in the natural world. God gives us his commandments to help us live according to His will. The greatest commandment unites the supernatural and natural world into one rule for us. We should love God, and when we love one another, we are loving God by loving them. Humans are body (natural) and soul (supernatural). If we are to love our neighbor in a holistic  Holistic means emphasizing the whole and showing concern about each of the component parts of a thing. way, we must show concern for their natural and supernatural needs. This is reflected in in the following passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:   “All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and love.  Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.” Catechism of the Catholic Church 1878  How do we care for the material needs of others? In many cases this is obvious. All people need food, water, and shelter. Providing access to quality healthcare is another way in which we love our neighbor through natural means. As Catholics, we should strive to ensure that our care for neighbor is not solely a material benefit, but a spiritual one as well. By incorporating empathy, compassion, friendship, and brotherly\/sisterly love into our material service to one another, we ensure that we are holistically loving our neighbor and serving their needs in the best possible way. The Catholic Church clearly shows us ways that we can care for the body and soul of our neighbor through the lists of corporal (bodily) and spiritual works of mercy.        Corporal works of mercy  Spiritual works of mercy    Feed the hungry  Counsel the doubtful    Give drink to the thirsty  Instruct the ignorant    Clothe the naked  Admonish sinners    Shelter the homeless  Comfort the afflicted    Visit the sick  Forgive offenses    Visit the imprisoned  Bear wrongs patiently    Bury the dead  Pray for the living and the dead     There are other less obvious ways in which we are also called to love our neighbor. Human beings are part of creation and exist within the environment around them. We must therefore show love to neighbor by ALSO showing respect for Creation. This is emphasized in the following quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as well as a couple of Papal encyclicals:   “The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.  Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.” Catechism of the Catholic Church 2415   “The environment is God's gift to everyone, and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole… In nature, the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God's creative activity, which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs, material or otherwise, while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation.” Caritas in Veritate 48.   “The created things of this world are not free of ownership: ‘For they are yours, O Lord, who love the living’ (Wis 11:26). This is the basis of our conviction that, as part of the universe, called into being by one Father, all of us are linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect.” Laudato si 89.   “Moreover, when our hearts are authentically open to universal communion, this sense of fraternity excludes nothing and no one. It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty towards any creature is ‘contrary to human dignity’. We can hardly consider ourselves to be fully loving if we disregard any aspect of reality: ‘Peace, justice and the preservation of creation are three absolutely interconnected themes, which cannot be separated and treated individually without once again falling into reductionism’” Laudato si 92.   Exercise 3: The Greatest Commandment     The Greatest Commandment sounds like two commandments. Explain why this is not the case.    Explain what I mean when I say that we are called to holistically love our neighbor.    Imagine that you receive healthcare in a clinic that is exceptional in healing you but is simultaneously cold and impersonal. How would you feel? Come up with concrete ideas for how you could prevent a patient from feeling this way if you were a medical professional.    Explain a concrete way in which our respect for the environment can manifest itself as love of neighbor. Similarly, explain a concrete way in which abuse of the environment can manifest itself in harming our neighbor.     Key:   Exercise 1:    Answers may vary (see the argument in the text to check for similarity to what you stated).    Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. Potency is some change that can be realized in a thing. Actus Purus is a term for God that describes Him as pure actuality without potency. Actuality brings forth potency. The first actualization must have been from Actus Purus.    They are exceptional but natural. They can be seen and touched. Their powers often work within nature (example: spiderman can only swing because of his webs).    Angels are supernatural (example: they don’t exist in one particular space; their movement defies the laws of physics). Angels can change and therefore possess potency. They can also influence other things and thus have actuality.    Angels are an example of something that is supernatural that nonetheless possesses potency. Only God is Actus Purus.    Human nature and human bodies are a part of God, through his Son, Jesus. God is therefore body and spirit, natural and supernatural. If we are to love God, we must love both parts. In caring for others, we must care for their bodily and spiritual needs.    When we say we should abandon materialism, we mean that we should abandon unhealthy attachments. For instance, food is good, but gluttony is sinful. We can avoid gluttony by practicing occasional fasting.    Exercise 2:    When we love one another, we love God’s creation and our neighbors. We cannot fully love God, without loving everything that comes from Him, including creation and our neighbors.    We are each body and spirit. In order to love our neighbor, we must show compassionate care for both their body and spirit.    I probably wouldn’t be very happy. I might feel disrespected or as-if I was just a source of income for the hospital\/doctor. If a doctor takes the time to have a real conversation with a patient rather than rushing through a visit, this can help to fulfill the spiritual needs to companionship that the patient has.    Picking up garbage along a hiking trail can help the next visitor more fully enjoy the beauty of God’s creation. Throwing away toxic chemicals can lead to them entering bodies of water that people swim in or get their drinking water from. This can lead to health problems for your neighbor.    "

What is matter and what is energy?       Section 1: What is science?    Science  Science is a method for systematically studying the observable world. is a methodology that allows us to learn about nature. People have been doing science since the beginning of mankind. The development of tools, hunting methods, agriculture, etc. were all dependent on knowledge gained through science. The methodology used for science wasn’t rigorously defined until 1620 when Francis Bacon published his work Novum Organum. Further refinements and definitions have led to what we now call the scientific method  A process that allows us to develop explanations for the observations about the natural world. The core steps are observe, hypothesize, and experiment. . This process begins with making observations about the natural world. These observations can lead to laws or hypotheses. Laws  Laws are statements that express a repeated pattern of behavior in nature. Laws do NOT seek to explain the cause of the behavior. are statements about patterns invariably observed in nature (you can basically think of them as an observation with elite status). They are rules that seek to explain what will happen in a given circumstance based on what has been observed again and again, without exception. A common example of a law is the law of gravity. It can be described in different ways: “what goes up must come down”, “objects with mass attract one another”, or even with a mathematical equation ( ). Note that these descriptions predict what will happen and may even provide a quantitative prediction, but they do NOT explain why. Laws do NOT have to be formalized in textbooks, though. For instance, I’d like to point out that most of us are familiar with the “law of glowing red metal” that states that glowing red metal is quite hot and probably shouldn’t be touched.  The scientific method starts with an observation or law, but progresses further by seeking to explain why nature behaves in the way it does. A statement that seeks to explain the causes of natural phenomena that is based on observations or laws is called a hypothesis  A statement that seeks to explain observations of nature. . A hypothesis is an explanation that has not been suitably tested. In order to lend support to a hypothesis, scientists often carry out experiments. A properly designed experiment tests the effect of a limited number of variables  The parameter or condition that is changed within an experiment. (ie. something that is changed, and therefore tested in an experiment) while striving to keep everything else as identical as possible. In a properly designed experiment, there are always a minimum of two possible groups: controls and experimental groups. The control groups  The groups within an experiment where the variable is unchanged. Positive controls attempt to cause the behavior to ensure that it can be observed. Negative controls often withhold the variable to allow for observation of what the behavior is in the absence of the variable. serve as comparisons, showing what the outcome is if the variable is ignored\/absent\/unchanged. The experimental group  Experimental groups include the variable and often involve changing it in some way (ex. amount of the variable, exposure time to the variable, etc.) consists of groups where the variable is changed. By comparing the results between the controls and experimental groups, we can reach conclusions about whether the experiment supports or refutes our hypothesis. Importantly, experiments can NEVER prove a hypothesis to be correct, instead they allow us to reject alternative explanations.  When interpreting the results of experiments and trying to develop explanations for the causes of an observation, one of the principles that guides all of science is known as Ockham’s razor, which states that the simplest explanation that is consistent with known experimental results is the one that should be held. William of Ockham, the namesake of Ockham’s razor, was a Catholic Franciscan friar in the 14 th century, and made several contributions to philosophy and theology. This further highlights the relationship between science, philosophy, and theology; the very roots of scientific thought and logic are grounded in philosophical and theological principles.  Using Ockham’s razor, scientists can begin to piece together models that explain their observations. These models can lead to further hypotheses and experiments. If a hypothesis has withstood numerous experiments, it can be considered to be a theory  A hypothesis that has substantial experimental support. Theories can never be proven. They can be supported to greater and greater degrees, but they can never reach absolute certainty. . A theory is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested (a single experiment or test is rarely enough) and has NEVER been shown to be inconsistent with an experimental result. Experimental results that conflict with a hypothesis do NOT have to lead to outright rejection of the hypothesis and often instead lead to revision or addition of clarifications or exceptions. The distinction between a hypothesis and a theory is subjective and open to interpretation, but scientists all agree that enough experiments should have been carried out to allow obvious alternate explanations to be rejected.  An example of the scientific method in action:  A carpenter observes that wood is a strong building material that is capable of holding a large amount of weight and wants to understand why. The carpenter hypothesizes that thick wood is capable of holding more weight than thin wood. To test this, the carpenter sets up a control group consisting of wood with a standard thickness and experimental groups that have wood with other thicknesses (either thicker or thinner). He then tests each group by observing how many books each piece of wood can hold before breaking. His results show that thin boards hold less weight than thick boards. We’d say that board thickness correlates  Correlation is when we observe a pattern or relationship between changing a variable and the observed response. For instance, if increasing the amount of an antibiotic leads to greater observation of bacterial cell death, we’d say that the antibiotic amount correlates with bacterial cell death. with board strength. While this result supports his hypothesis, there are still other possible explanations for the result. For instance, perhaps the process used for reducing the thickness of the boards damaged the wood by introducing cracks. Alternatively, the thin pieces of wood might have had more (or fewer) wood grains and that might instead have been the source of the observed outcomes. . Correlation does not equal causation!   Exercise 1: What is science?     Come up with 3 additional laws of nature that you have encountered in your own life that you won’t find listed in a science textbook.    Come up with 3 ways in which you used the scientific method in your own life without realizing what you were doing.    Look around you right now. Observe something and write it down. Try to develop a hypothesis that explains that observation. Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. Why controls would you need? What results would you expect that would validate your hypothesis?    Why is it important to develop alternative explanations to experimental observations?    It is seen that lead exposure levels correlate with crime rates. Does this mean that lead exposure causes crime? If not, what come up with some alternative explanations.     Section 2: The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics   The modern world is obsessed with science. It is easy to think of science as a modern marvel, and indeed some people have begun to deify  Deify means to treat it like a God. In this case, I mean that science has begun to replace God in the minds of many people in today’s society. People look to science for solutions to all of their problems. People also look to science to find explanations about humanity’s purpose and dignity (or lack thereof) within the context of nature. it. The discoveries of scientists have in many cases dramatically improved life for people around the world and promise to work wonders such as the eradication of disease (even if some of these promises seem far off). Many of the observations of nature that in history appeared miraculous now have scientific explanations and theories. For instance, the variety of life of Earth is now widely believed (even amongst Catholic scientists) to have resulted from evolution rather than a single creation event (it’s worth noting, less you think of this as a source of conflict between faith and science that Catholic scientists still believe in a Creation event, but that the events that followed and their timing differ from a literal reading of Genesis). Because of this, many people have come to reject religion as superstitious nonsense, since science appears (to some) as if it might be able to explain all natural phenomena. Many modern atheists use statements like this to argue that if God is not necessary to explain anything in nature, then it doesn’t make sense to believe in the existence of God. They of course forget that science is a tool for investigating only what can be observed in nature , and therefore it’s incapable of investigating the existence God. Furthermore, as we learned about in the previous lesson, supernatural causes are a logical necessity for the existence of nature. Additionally, the scientific method depends on change for experiments to work (recall that changes are actualization of some potency). All changes must ultimately have their root in Actus Purus…something that modern atheists conveniently ignore.  On the other extreme, many people are prone to reject scientific progress for a variety of reasons. Indeed, scientific investigations and technological “advances” have created numerous problems for society, and it is understandable why people have developed a distrust of science as a result. In the 1920s, a scientist named Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered that the addition of a chemical compound containing lead into gasoline could help it burn in a more reliable way in car engines. Leaded gasoline was thus introduced and was used in the United States until 1996. Over that time, vast quantities of lead were released into the environment and resulted in a variety of toxic effect. In a different example, in the Tuskegee syphilis study, several hundred black men with syphilis in the United States had treatment unknowingly withheld from them so that scientists could study the long-term effects of the disease. Once the details of this horrendous study came to light, it understandably had a negative impact on the trust of black Americans for the American medical community   The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Volume 133, Issue 1, February 2018, Pages 407–455 .  Nowadays, there are many prominent examples of mistrust between the scientific community and various groups of people. Global warming and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are two prominent areas. In this text, I’ll neither argue for or against those issues, but instead focus on the root cause of the distrust. Some of the distrust stems from the fact that different scientific studies can sometimes arrive at different conclusions. The reasons for this are complex and varied, but so are the subjects being studied.  For instance, one study might show that chemical X causes cancer while another study doesn’t. This disagreement might be due to differences in the amounts of chemical X used in the study, the amount of time of the exposure, the use of mice vs. rabbits, the type of test used, etc. Cancer is a very complex disease, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the studies and factors that influence its occurrence are complex as well.  Similarly, in the field of climatology (the study of climate) there are studies and data that show evidence of man’s role in global warming and other data that disputes this. Can science come to meaningful conclusions then? In cases where different studies have different outcomes and conclusions, the scientific community tries to carry out more and better designed studies in an effort to arrive at a consensus  A consensus is a general belief amongst scientists that a particular theory is true. This is arrived at by comparing the quality of experiments and their conclusions throughout the scientific community as well as the number of studies that support a particular conclusion. . , but a consensus represents the belief that the majority of the best studies support a particular theory.  The bias  A preference that prevents fair judgment of researchers can also play a role in science. An ethical scientist tries to avoid bias, but it can be difficult to eliminate entirely, especially since the importance of a scientific discovery is often linked to funding. In some cases, bias can and has led to incorrect interpretations of data, outright falsification of data, and entirely incorrect conclusions. However, bias is present in pretty much every part of life, with examples ranging from restaurant preferences to political decision making. Bias shouldn’t be a reason to distrust all scientists and scientific theories, but it is important to scrutinize scientific conclusions, especially when they begin to impact our lives, the lives of others, and\/or our environment.  Another reason for distrust of science has to deal with a misunderstanding of what science is. I would argue that much of the disagreement and distrust of science in our society is not at science at all, but rather at engineering  Engineering seeks to solve problems by creating solutions. It relies of science to explain how things work so that engineering can figure out how to use them to solve a problem. and even more so politics  Politics is not a major focus of this course. However, politics is related to science an engineering because politics should seek the welfare of the people in society. Politics can encourage the use of engineering to solve problems and can encourage scientific discovery, both of which can be used for political goals. . Engineering and science are closely related and interdependent fields. Where science seeks answers to the causes of things, engineering seeks to use that knowledge to create solutions to problems. Politics is related to both fields since our political leaders strive (or should strive) to find the best ways to use scientific knowledge and engineering creations to further the good of society.  As an example, let’s take the example of the Covid vaccines. A combination of scientific discoveries and engineering advancements lead to the development of the first Covid vaccines. Their purpose was to combat the Covid-19 virus, which was rapidly spreading across the globe. The disease was poorly understood and was able to cause death, hence the desire for rapid vaccine development (a political decision). The development of the vaccine was extremely rapid, thanks to many advances in biochemical engineering and science. Political pressure led to the implementation of the vaccine before thorough testing by scientists and engineers had been accomplished. Vaccine mandates followed, and whether justified or not, they were undoubtedly controversial. Again, though, vaccine mandates are not science, they are political actions. Many people have argued that the vaccines were untested, ineffective, and potentially harmful and that science failed in these regards. I would argue that scientists and engineers did not fail at all, but actually performed extraordinarily well. The scientific method takes considerable time and in the case of the Covid vaccine, due to political decisions, much of the discoveries of scientists lagged behind the roll out of the vaccines and their mandatory implementation. Indeed, scientists can’t test the effectiveness and safety of something that hasn’t been created yet. The decision to roll out the vaccines before the typical years worth of testing were complete wasn’t a decision of scientists but one of politicians. Many scientists definitely contributed to those political decisions, but it’s important to realize that they weren’t acting as scientists but as activists  One who tries to influence public opinion. Scientists can potentially do this in ethical ways or unethical ways. in those instances. Activists can act in ethical or unethical ways, and the same goes for scientists (and I’ll leave it to the reader to form their own opinions in this case). I’d even argue that activism is a necessity among scientists; if scientists can’t advocate for the importance of their research, then it won’t get the funding or support that is needed to carry it out (in many ways this is like a small business owner advertising a new product…but I digress…). Now, years after the vaccine rollout, biologists have largely reached a consensus about the effectiveness and safety of the Covid-19 vaccines. The majority of scientific research supports the conclusion that the initial vaccines weren’t very effective at preventing the spread of the disease, though they were effective in lessening its severity. Additionally, statistical analysis revealed that there are a variety of safety issues that correlated with the initial vaccines, though their rate of occurrence was quite low. The scientific method didn’t fail us, but it took time to carry out the studies and arrive at conclusions. Unfortunately, and perhaps unavoidably, the lines between science, engineering, and politics are often blurred and this can regrettably result in distrust in science and scientists for reasons that aren’t science at all.  When science and technology are deified, great error can result. On the other hand, lack of trust in scientists and their conclusions can lead to distrust and animosity and can potentially lead to the rejection of engineering advances that can help mankind. What then is the proper attitude to take towards science and its relationship to faith and human flouring? Read the following text from the Church’s Pastoral Constitution, Gaudium et Spes :  “Christians, on pilgrimage toward the heavenly city, should seek and think of these things which are above. This duty in no way decreases, rather it increases, the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the building of a more human world. Indeed, the mystery of the Christian faith furnishes them with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this duty more courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity, one which gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man.  When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of technology, in order that it might bear fruit and become a dwelling worthy of the whole human family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social groups, he carries out the design of God manifested at the beginning of time, that he should subdue the earth, perfect creation and develop himself. At the same time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself at the service of his brethren.  Furthermore, when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy, history and of mathematical and natural science, and when he cultivates the arts, he can do very much to elevate the human family to a more sublime understanding of truth, goodness, and beauty, and to the formation of considered opinions which have universal value. Thus mankind may be more clearly enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which was with God from all eternity, composing all things with him, rejoicing in the earth, delighting in the sons of men.  In this way, the human spirit, being less subjected to material things, can be more easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator. Moreover, by the impulse of grace, he is disposed to acknowledge the Word of God, Who before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was already \"in the world\" as \"the true light which enlightens every man\" (John 1:9-10).  Indeed today's progress in science and technology can foster a certain exclusive emphasis on observable data, and an agnosticism about everything else. For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth. By virtue of their methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things. Indeed the danger is present that man, confiding too much in the discoveries of today, may think that he is sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher things.  Those unfortunate results, however, do not necessarily follow from the culture of today, nor should they lead us into the temptation of not acknowledging its positive values. Among these values are included: scientific study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries, the necessity of working together with others in technical groups, a sense of international solidarity, a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even to protect men, the desire to make the conditions of life more favorable for all, especially for those who are poor in culture or who are deprived of the opportunity to exercise responsibility. All of these provide some preparation for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which can be animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world.”  Pure science is a tool that humanity can use to gain knowledge of God’s creation. Knowledge of creation sheds light on its Creator and is therefore a commendable exercise for a Christian to undertake. Unfortunately, human history is filled with examples of the knowledge of science being misused for sinful purposes. The use of knowledge is distinct from the knowledge itself, often involving other human enterprises such as medicine, business, politics, etc. Science itself is not free from sin either. When scientists place the pursuit of knowledge above the laws of God, unethical experimentation can result.   Exercise 2: The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics     I’d argue that science is an essential part of what makes us human. Do you agree or disagree? Why?    The text above describes two very different ways in which science is misunderstood in society. Explain these two ways in your own words.    How are engineering, science, and politics related?    One of the footnotes above says that scientists can be activists in ethical ways or unethical ways. Do you agree? What requirements would you have for a scientist to behave as an ethical activist?    How can science aid faith? How can faith aid science?    Science can lead to knowledge about the natural world. How is that knowledge connected to our love of God? (Think back to the last lesson)    What are some ethical science problems that you foresee yourself having to contend with in your profession? How might you deal with this?    Academic pursuits (such as you are now undertaking) are full of ethical struggles as you strive to acquire knowledge and progress toward your vocation. In many ways this is similar to the ethical dilemmas encountered by scientists. Come up with 3 ways in which a student might be tempted to sin as they pursue knowledge and advancement.    Christ has conquered sin and has redeemed the world. Use this fact to compose a short prayer that you can use is difficult ethical moments throughout your academic and professional career.     Section 3: Chemistry   Modern science is separated into the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. There is considerable overlap between these subjects since each discipline can influence the others. Chemistry  Chemistry studies the properties of matter. This includes how matter interacts with energy, how matter is structures, how matter behaves in a variety of conditions, etc. is the study of the properties of matter  Matter is difficult to define exactly. Our definition is that matter must have mass and occupy space. It is essentially the “stuff” that is in the universe. . Matter can be defined as anything that occupies space and has mass  Mass is difficult to define in physics. If something has inertia (the ability to resist changes in movement) or exerts gravitational attraction to other objects, then that object has mass. Mass can be quantified to determine the extent to which an object has inertia or can exhibit gravitational attraction. . Basically, everything that you can see and touch is matter. Even particles that are too small to be seen, such as atoms and molecules, are still matter because they occupy space and have mass. Energy (defined in a later chapter), on the other hand, is NOT matter. It is a property that matter can have, but it is not a thing that occupies space. Light and heat are things that we can experience in the physical world, but they lack mass and thus are not matter. Sound is another example of energy. Sound is caused by the vibration of matter, but it refers to the vibration, not to the particles that are vibrating.  Chemistry is often referred to as the central science. This is because to fully understand the behavior and properties of matter, we first have to understand the laws of physics. Physics provides chemistry with information about the composition of matter and its most basic parts. It also provides chemists with an understanding of energy and how it interacts with matter. At the same time, all organisms are comprised of matter; thus, if we want to understand life, we need to understand the matter that comprises it. Chemistry aids biology by helping us understand how organisms function and can also help us learn how to manipulate biology, for instance by designing pharmaceuticals or pesticides.   Exercise 3: Chemistry, health, and ethics     Write down the definitions of chemistry, matter, and mass.    Are the following best described as matter or energy?    The heat from a fire    The smoke from a fire    The vibration of a string on a violin    A string on a violin      What are your career goals (discuss this with your group)? How might the knowledge of chemistry help you in your career?    Even if you never directly use the knowledge from this course in your profession, does this course still have value to you? Is knowledge without purpose worthless?     Key:   Exercise 1:      The law of melting butter. When you heat butter, it turns into a liquid.    The law of successful campfires. Camp fires burn best when they have adequate ventilation near the bottom.    The law of autumn. Leaves turn from green to yellow, orange, or red in the fall.        I try out different amounts of time when frying eggs to see whether the yolk is hard or runny. (experiment)    I observe that when I hit the up volume button on the remote control, the TV gets louder (observation)    I think that my lawn is turning brown because it needs more water (hypothesis)      Light is coming through various sized slits in the blinds in my room. I think that light can always pass through any gap, no matter how small. I get two objects that can move to change the gap size between them. I place a light behind them and observe if the light can pass through at various gap sizes. A negative control would be if the objects were pressed together so no gap exists. A positive control would be the light itself without the objects to create the gap (to just make sure that I can see the light and that it’s working.    These can remind us that scientific theories are never certain. Also, they can help us design new experiments to add greater certainty to theories (or possibly to prove them wrong).    Not necessarily. Perhaps people who are exposed to higher levels of lead tend to be more impoverished. Perhaps that poverty is the root cause of the high crime rate.    Exercise 2:    Humans are created to know and wonder. Science is the way in which we can do this in the natural world    Science can be misunderstood to be the “answer to our prayers”. Science can also be distrusted because of how it is utilized for engineering and political purposes. Scientific investigations can also be carried out in unethical ways.    Politics tries to encourage human flourishing. It needs solutions to problems, which is the purpose of engineering. Engineering relies on knowledge from science in order to design good solutions to problems.    An ethical activist\/scientist should not state their theories as scientific fact. They should also present the best synopsis of the available knowledge (and alternative explanations).    Science can remove superstition from faith and correct errors in our knowledge. Faith can allow science to pursue worthwhile knowledge in ethical ways.    Knowledge of nature is knowledge of God’s Creation and thus provides insight into God Himself. It can also provide us the knowledge to better care for our neighbors. In the last lesson we learned that love of neighbor is inseparable from love of God.    Varied answers    Varied answers    Varied answers    Exercise 3:    See the definitions in the text    Are the following best described as matter or energy?    Energy    Matter    Energy    Matter      Varies    Varies. Knowledge about creation contains knowledge of God. Knowing God is obviously good, so pursuing any knowledge of creation has inherent goodness.    "

In chemistry, they have many uses as we’ll see if upcoming chapters and exercises. The most common math that we do with fractions in chemistry is multiplying and dividing them. To carry out multiplication of fractions, we simply multiply together all of the values in the numerators  The numerator is the top of a fraction (the top of the fraction), keeping the product in the numerator of the final answer, and then do a similar operation with the denominator  The denominator is the bottom of a fraction (the bottom of the fraction).  Multiplication of fractions example 1:     Multiplication of fractions example 2:     Dividing fractions is similarly quite easy to do. In a division problem, the first number is the dividend (the number being divided) and the second is the divisor (the number that the dividend is being divided into). Division of fractions can be expressed in multiple ways     Please note that the dividend is the numerator in the fraction expression and the divisor becomes the denominator. To complete this division problem, we simply need to flip the divisor and multiply that value by the dividend.      Exercise 1: Fraction math review     Fraction math. Do the following math problems                                 Section 2: Canceling out factors and labels in calculations   Another VERY important lesson to remember about fractions is that if the numerator and denominator both contain the same factor, then they cancel out. This is true for both numbers in the fractions but also for labels like units. See the examples below:  Example 1: (the 3s cancel out)   Example 2: (the “miles” labels cancel out)      Exercise 2: Canceling out factors and labels in calculations     Simplify the following expressions                            Section 3: Scientific notation   In chemistry, we frequently have to make use of very large numbers (e.g. when we’re discussing numbers of atoms) as well as very small numbers (e.g. the weight of an atom). We have a couple of strategies that make this much more palatable for us. One such strategy is to have different units of measurement for discussing large numbers vs. small numbers. The other common approach is to use scientific notation. Ultimately scientific notation is required, even if we use different units, because we still need to use very large (or small) numbers to express the relationship between these different units. For example, if we are talking about the distance across an atom, a common unit of measurement is an Angstrom. A hydrogen atom has a diameter of approximately 1.1 Angstroms. But how many inches is that? In order to convert between units of Angstroms and inches we'd have to know that 1 Angstrom = 0.00000000394 inches. Working with that number is obviously obnoxious, requiring us to count exactly how many zeroes there are. To get around this, we like to use scientific notation.   a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base   To write a number in scientific notation, we combine a coefficient The coefficient is the leading part of scientific notation. It should always be a number between 1 and 10 and should be written as a decimal. with a base The base follows the coefficient in scientific notation. It is multiplied by the base. It is always 10 raised to some integer power. . The coefficient is always a number that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and is written as a decimal. The coefficient is then multiplied by the base which is 10 raised to some power.    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    A positive power makes the coefficient larger by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the right by the number of digit places given by the number in the power. Conversely, a negative power makes the coefficient smaller by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the left by the number of digit places given by the number in the power.  We also have to be able to take a number that is written in standard notation and rewrite it in scientific notation. To do this, we move the decimal point in the direction that will result in a coefficient that has a value between 1 and 10. We count the number of digit places that we moved the decimal and that becomes the value in the power. If we moved the decimal to the left, then the power remains positive. If the decimal had to be moved to the right, then the value in the power becomes negative.     a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    One of the things that often confuses students about scientific notation is remembering when to move the decimal to the right or the left. These rules can be summed up by remembering the simple rule that big numbers have positive powers and small numbers have negative powers. Remembering this rule can help you determine for yourself whether you should move the decimal right or left.   Exercise 3: Scientific notation     Do the following math problems       Write the following numbers in scientific notation.    3,001.002    5,000,005    10,055,057,001    0.000 057 8    0.08    0.000 000 007 044      Write the following numbers in standard notation.

Section 4: Scientific notation and calculators   Doing multi-step calculations often leads to errors. These errors often result from incorrect calculator usage. It is important to make sure that you are correctly inputting scientific notation into your calculator. Often the correct way to do this is using the EE button on your calculator. If, on the other hand, you input scientific notation using the times button and then your exponent button, you may inadvertently input the incorrect math problem. See the example below:     4.1 EE 3 “divided by” 3.3 EE 10 =   4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 “divided by” 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10  This incorrect input above is actually calculating the following:   Another way that you can correctly input scientific notation is to put parentheses around each of your scientific notation inputs. This allows you to input the scientific notation using whichever method you’d prefer.  ( 4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 ) “divided by” ( 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10)  Another important calculator rule to remember is that when we write complex fractions, all of the operations in the numerator and denominator respectively are carried out before the division step. This is correctly input into a calculator by remembering to put parentheses around both the numerator and denominator. See the example below:     ( 7 “plus” 3 ) “divided by” ( 5.5 EE 3 “plus” 100 ) =    Exercise 4: Scientific notation and calculators .     Complete the following problems using your calculator.                           Section 5: Algebra review   The final part of this math review is a brief review of algebra. We use algebra to rearrange mathematical expressions to solve for some unknown. There are two things to remember when doing algebraic rearrangements. First, our goal is to isolate the variable of interest, remembering that it must be in the numerator if we’re dealing with fractions. Second, the way in which we will isolate the variable is by carrying out . See the examples below:   Exercise 5: Algebra review.     For the following problems, solve for the value of c. In some cases your solution will be an expression rather than a number. Write out all of your steps                                Key:   Exercise 1:        28\/9    42\/30=7\/5    16\/9    (adc)\/(bca)=d\/b    35\/27    Exercise 2.        3\/2    3    x\/y    300min    Exercise 3:                                                                              Exercise 3, problem 2: Same as problem 1  Exercise 4:                            Exercise 5:        3\/2    275\/9         8    20 hr    "

  "body": " Basics of Matter   Summary:     How matter is classified    Mixtures vs. pure substances    Homogenous vs. heterogeneous mixtures      Relationship between elements and compounds    Idea of an atom    Law of constant composition      States of matter    Properties of solids, liquids, and gases    Odd-ball cases       Section 1: Classification of matter   There are different ways to classify matter, but this diagram is one that that can help you compartmentalize your knowledge throughout the course. The diagram strives to classify matter according to its complexity and arrangement. This sort of classification has historical importance to chemistry because it what allowed scientists to begin to gain an understanding of what matter is made of. For instance, it is essential to know what an element is in order to understand that a compound is made up of elements.  The highest classes of matter on the chart are mixtures  Matter that consists of multiple pure substances. The pure substances can be separated by physical processes. and pure substances  Matter that cannot be separated into different components by physical processes. . The difference between these terms is that mixtures consist of multiple substances, while pure substances are only one. The difference between these can be obvious, but that isn’t always the case. For instance, you can clearly see that a glass of sand and water contains multiple substances because we can see the sand and the water and they clearly appear to be different. In the case of salt water, it would be difficult to determine whether it’s a mixture of substances (water and salt) by simply looking at it. Sugar, is a pure substance, but brass is not…so how do we know that something is a pure substance or a mixture?  This is not as straightforward as it might initially seem, but we can come up with rules to help us out. A mixture contains two different substances AND those substances can be separated by physical processes  Physical processes are ones that don’t change the identity of a substance. . A physical process is a one that doesn’t need other substances to be added. Also a physical process will preserve the identity and characteristics of each of the components. Easy examples are boiling and freezing a liquid. The identity of that liquid is the same if it’s a solid, liquid, or gas despite it having somewhat different characteristics. Other examples of physical processes include filtering, cutting, sorting, etc. Sand and water can be separated by filtration, a physical process, and therefore sandy water is classified as a mixture. In the example of salt water we know that it is a mixture because we can separate it into its components (salt and water) by boiling the water and taking advantage of the fact that salt and water have different physical properties  Physical properties are properties of a material that can be discovered while preserving the identity of the substance . A physical property is a property (like boiling point, freezing point, size, color, etc.) that can be observed without altering the chemical identity of a substance.  Within the category of mixtures, we have homogenous mixtures  Homogeneous mixtures consist of two or more pure substances that are mixed in a uniform manner. and heterogenous mixtures  Heterogeneous mixtures consist of two or more pure substances that are mixed in a non-uniform manner . The difference between these terms deals with the arrangement of the components. If the components are evenly distributed throughout the mixture, then we have a homogeneous mixture. If the arrangement is not uniform, then it’s a heterogeneous mixture. Heterogeneous mixtures are sometimes obvious, like sand in water; if you let it sit for a little while the sand settles to the bottom. Sometimes heterogeneous mixtures are not immediately identifiable as such. Consider blood; it initially looks like a uniform red liquid. However, if you let it sit for a little while, the cells in the blood will soon settle to the bottom of the container, similar to sand in water.  In a homogeneous mixture, the various substances are evenly distributed, even at a microscopic level. Because of this, you will not see the various particles that make up a homogeneous mixture. Solutions  A homogeneous mixture where one pure substance is dissolved into another are homogeneous mixtures where one substance (the solute  The lesser component of a solution is called the solute ) is dissolved in a larger amount of the second substance (the solvent  The major component of a solution is called the solvent ). The solvent and the solute can be the same state of matter or different states. For instance, oxygen gas can be dissolved in water, forming a solution. Salt can also be dissolved in water. Gases can be dissolved in one another (for example, air is a solution where small amounts of oxygen gas, carbon dioxide, etc. are dissolved in the solvent of nitrogen gas). There are also solutions made of metals, and these are called alloys  Homogeneous mixtures of metals are called alloys . Bronze is a mixture of zinc and copper where the two substances have so fully dispersed that the mixture is now uniform. Homogenous mixtures can still be separated by physical processes, but they often require more effort (ex. many heterogeneous mixtures can be separated by filtration, whereas a homogenous mixture may require boiling, condensing, or melting).  Pure substances, on the other hand, cannot be separated by physical processes. If you boil pure liquid water, it will be entirely converted into water vapor. If you condense the water vapor it will entirely turn back into liquid water. In both cases, there isn’t any substance that is separated from the water or water vapor by carrying out these physical processes; the substance remains unchanged. Physical processes cannot change the composition of a pure substance. The discovery of pure substances and their further classification into elements and compounds was essential to our understanding of the composition of the world around us. This will be further explored in the next section.   Exercise 1: Classification of matter     Identify the following as being a mixture or pure substance    Soda    Wood    Air    Oxygen gas    Iron    Table salt    A DNA molecule      Identify the following mixtures as homogeneous or heterogeneous    Wood    Soda    Steel    Bronze    Granite    Fog      Which of the following properties are physical properties?    A piece of wood can be cut in half    That apple is red    1 gram of sugar can be dissolved into a liter of water    Sugar can be set on fire    An iron fence rusts when exposed to water    Lead can be removed from water by filtration    A plate is brittle       Section 2: Relationship between elements and compounds   Pure substances can be subdivided into elements  Elements are pure substances that cannot be broken down further by chemical processes and compounds  Compounds are pure substances that consist of two or more elements. They can only be separated into their component elements by chemical processes. . The distinction between elements and compounds depends on whether they can be broken down into simpler units by chemical processes  A chemical process is a reaction that changes the identity of a substance . A chemical process is a reaction that often (but not always) involves the addition of one or more additional reactants and always results in the chemical identity of the starting substance changing. Chemical processes may result in a significant change in the appearance of the starting substance or evolution of a gas, but in other cases there may be little obvious indication that a reaction has occurred (that’s a subject that is covered in other classes like organic chemistry in much more detail). If a pure substance can be broken down into simpler units by a chemical process, then we’re dealing with a compound. If it can’t, then we’re dealing with an element.  We now know of the existence of over 100 different elements. Each element can be found arranged in the periodic table  An organized table that displays the elements and additional information about each one. (more about the periodic table in a later chapter). If you can find a substance in the periodic table, then it’s an element. The cells in the periodic table contain information about each element. For right now, we’ll focus on the name each element as well as its element symbol  An abbreviation for an element consisting of one or more letters , a short abbreviation that is used to represent that element (example: H is the element symbol for hydrogen). Many of these element symbols make sense with the English name of the element. Other element symbols are derived from the Latin name of the element (example: sodium is called natrium in Latin and its symbol is Na).  What then is the relationship between an element and a compound. This relationship was one of the key discoveries in chemistry, and its discovery opened up our understanding of the foundational composition of all matter. One of these early insights came from the discovery of the Law of constant composition  The law of constant composition states that the ratio of elements in a compound is always a constant . This law states that compounds always have the same ratio of elements. For instance, water always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 8 grams of oxygen. Methane, another compound, always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 3 grams of carbon. This discovery showed scientists that compounds were comprised of elements in very specific ratios.  The next key discovery came from comparing the ratios of elements in one compound to the ratios found in other compounds where both compounds consisted of the same elements. For instance, methane has a 1:3 ratio between the mass of hydrogen and the mass of carbon as stated in the previous paragraph. Ethane is another compound made of carbon and hydrogen, but the ratio between hydrogen and carbon is 1:4. If we divide these two ratios we get a ratio of 4:3, meaning that ethane contains 4\/3 as much carbon as methane. This can be done for many other pairs of compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. If we do this, we get other ratios like 1:2, 1:3, or 3:2. In every case, we begin to see that when we divide the ratios of carbon and hydrogen between two compounds, we always get ratios of integers ! This is known as the Law of multiple proportions  The law of multiple proportions states that if you divide the ratios of elements for two different compounds that contain the same elements, you will always get a ratio of integers . The realization that there are integer relationships between the composition of different compounds means that the carbon and hydrogen in these compounds occurs in discrete countable units . These discrete countable units are called atoms  The smallest unit of an element. .  Thanks to the Law of constant composition and the law of multiple proportions, we now know that all compounds are comprised of atoms of various elements that are combined together a specific ratio. This ratio can be written as a chemical formula  A way of showing how many atoms of a given element make up a single unit of a chemical compound . The formula for a compound is written by listing the element symbol followed by a subscript number indicating the number of atoms of that element that comprise the compound’s formula unit (please note, that if there is only one atom of a particular type that the number 1 is NOT written). So Na 2 SO 4 has 2 sodium atoms, one sulfur atom, and 4 oxygen atoms in every unit of that compound.   Exercise 2: Relationship between elements and compounds     Explain the Law of constant composition in your own words.    Identify the following as elements or compounds    Sugar    DNA    Gold    Antimony    NaF    CCl 4       What is the ratio of chlorine to carbon in CCl 4 ? How many of each type of atom are in this compound?    What is the ratio of carbon to chlorine in C 2 Cl 6 ? How many of each atom type are in this compound?    Divide the ratios of chlorine to carbon that you got in problems 3 and 4. What ratio do you get? Is this consistent with the Law of multiple proportions? Explain.    Look up the formula for sucrose (table sugar). Do the same for insulin (a peptide hormone)? How many of each type of atom are in these molecules?     Section 3: States of matter   The states of matter  Three different forms that matter can adopt while preserving its identity. The states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. are solids, liquids, and gases. When a substance undergoes a change in its state, it still retains its same chemical identity, and thus state changes are reversible. Water still has its same chemical formula and identity regardless of whether it is ice, liquid water, or water vapor. Each of these states has different properties, but they are properties of that state, not of water itself.  The properties that define a solid  A state of matter that has a fixed shape and a fixed volume are that it has a fixed shape and volume. Solids do not flow. They can change shape but require some outside force to cause this to happen (like bending a nail with a hammer). On a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the particles that make up the solid are held together by forces that are so strong that the particles can’t move past one another. As a result, the arrangement of the particles is fixed, and the shape of the substance as a whole remains fixed.   Liquids  A state of matter that can flow and has a fixed volume but a variable shape. It will take on the shape of its container , on the other hand, have a fixed volume, but not a fixed shape. They will take on the shape of their container. Liquids can flow and move in response to gravity. On a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the attractive forces between the particles are strong enough to maintain contact between the particles but weak enough that the particles can move past one another. As a result, the entire liquid is capable of movement and flow. At the same time, the attraction between the particles ensures that they never fully separate, so the volume remains fixed regardless of the shape.   Gases  A state of matter that has a variable shape and volume. A gas will take on the shape and volume of its container have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. A gas will always fill up the entirety of the container that it is placed in. Gases can flow like liquids, but their component particles have enough energy that they can flow in all directions, completely filling up their container. The microscopic reason for these properties is that the particles in a gas are moving so rapidly past one another that they don’t interact at all (in actuality, there are very small interactions between gas particles, but chemists often ignore this). As a result a gas will always spread out to occupy the entirety of its container, meaning that a gas will not have a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.  The reason for the differences between the states of matter is that the particles that make them up have different amounts of kinetic energy  Energy of motion . Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is affected by both the mass of an object and its velocity (ex. a baseball thrown by a toddler will hurt a lot less than by one thrown by a professional pitcher due to the difference in velocity and hence the difference in kinetic energy). The particles in a gas are moving much faster than those in a liquid; the particles in a liquid are moving much faster than those in a solid. Because of this, we can conclude that the particles in a gas have more kinetic energy than those in a liquid and that those in a liquid have more have more kinetic energy than those in a solid. So in order to turn a solid into a liquid ( melting  The process of converting a substance from a solid to a liquid ), we have to add energy to the substance by heating it. The same is true for turning a liquid into a gas ( boiling  The process of converting a substance from a liquid to a gas. or vaporizing  Same as boiling ). If we want to turn a gas into a liquid ( condensing  The process of converting a gas into a liquid ) we have to remove kinetic energy from the substance by cooling it. The same is true for freezing  The process of converting a liquid into a solid a substance (the process of turning a liquid into a solid).   Exercise 3: States of matter     If kinetic energy is added to water, it will eventually turn into a ________ (solid\/gas). Select one.    Sometimes substances can resemble multiple states of matter (ex. jello). What properties of jello resemble solid? Which ones are like a liquid?    Even some substances that appear to be solid can have properties of other states. Some people would argue that glass is actually a liquid. Skim the following article and explain what properties glass has that makes people think it’s a liquid and why it has this strange behavior. Article link: https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/chemistry\/is-glass-a-liquid-or-a-solid         Key:   Exercise 1:      Mixture    Mixture    Mixture    Pure substance    Pure substance    Pure substance    Pure substance        Heterogeneous    Homogeneous    Homogeneous    Homogeneous    Heterogeneous    Heterogeneous      J    Physical    Physical    Physical    Not physical (chemical)    Not physical (chemical)    Physical    Physical      Exercise 2:    Every chemical compound consists of a particular and unvarying ratio of different atoms    J    Compound    Compound    Element    Element    Compound    Compound      4:1 ratio, 4 chlorines, 1 carbon    3:1 ratio (or 6:2), 6 chlorines, 2 carbons    4:3 or 3:4 Yes. Both of these are ratios of integers    12 carbons, 22 hydrogens, 11 oxygens (sucrose)    256 carbons, 381 hydrogens, 65 nitrogens, 77 oxygens, and 6 sulfurs (insulin)  Exercise 3:    Gas    Solid: fixed volume; fixed shape (if it doesn’t move) Liquid: shape isn’t fixed; slowly flows to take the shape of its container    Bottom of old glass can be bulged; this gives the impression that the glass flows down over time; glass does flow, but not that fast; flow of glass is due to disordered molecular structure that makes it easier for parts to flow past one another    "

  "title": "Basics of Energy",
  "body": " Basics of Energy    Summary:     Energy, heat, and temperature    What is meant by all 3 terms    Converting between different units of energy    Converting between different units of temperature      Energy in food    Calculating how many Calories are in a serving of food      Light and electromagnetic radiation    Wavelength and frequency    Energy    Relative position of types of light on the electromagnetic spectrum       Section 1: Energy, heat and temperature   You just learned about kinetic energy, but was is energy itself? In order to understand energy, we must first define work  Applying a force to an object over some distance . Work is when a force is applied to an object over some distance. Energy  The capacity of an object to do work or produce heat or light is a property of an object or substance that describes its ability to do work, or to produce light or heat. Energy is a very important consideration in chemistry. It influences the properties of matter, including its state and temperature. Additionally, energy may be released or consumed by reactions. All reactions require energy input to occur, and some require so much energy that they won’t occur unless the reaction is heated or there is a spark (ex. a mixture of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas will not react with one another unless the reaction is provided with a flame or spark to get it going).  Energy can be subdivided into two classes: kinetic energy  Energy of motion and potential energy  Stored energy . Kinetic energy is energy of motion or vibration. Potential energy is stored energy that could potentially be converted into kinetic energy. A classic physics example is that a boulder sitting on a small hill has a small amount of potential energy compared to the same boulder sitting on top of a mountain. Due to the height difference, the boulder would speed up more if it were pushed off the mountain than a small hill. Once the boulder is pushed, the potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy. In chemistry, we’re not usually thinking about boulders rolling down hills. Instead, energy is stored in the form of bonds  Forces that hold atoms or molecules together that join atoms and molecules together. When this energy is released, the motion of the atoms or molecules increases.  The movement of atoms and molecules, including rotations and vibrations, is chemical kinetic energy. When we measure temperature  Quantification of the amount of kinetic energy contained in the molecules of an object what we are measuring is the amount of chemical kinetic energy in a substance. As energy is added to a substance, the temperature generally increases, and this is due to increased motion of the particles that make it up.  Both energy and temperature are quantifiable in chemistry. The SI units of energy are joules. In this course, due to its focus on health sciences, we will more commonly use the unit of calorie (1 calorie = 4.184 joules). The unit calories (abbreviate cal) can use the metric prefixes that you’ve previously learned with the most commonly version being a kilocalorie, or kcal. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy that will raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. When we’re dealing with the energy content of food, we often use units of Calories (note that it is now capitalized). 1 Calorie is equivalent to 1kcal or 1000 calories.  For temperature, we have 2 units that are commonly used by society (Fahrenheit and Celsius) and another that is used extensively in science (Kelvin). Fahrenheit is related to Celsius by the following formula:     In this formula, the 1.8 and 32 are EXACT numbers. Kelvin is a temperature scale that has its zero point at absolute zero (ie. the coldest possible temperature where there is no motion). To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, we use the following formula:     Kelvin will always have a positive value, and for this reason, it often must be used as the unit of temperature in scientific formulas. Using these two formulae, we can easily convert between different temperature units by using some algebra skills:  Example: Express the temperature in Celsius and Kelvin.    We have a formula to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius and another formula to go from Celsius to Kelvin. Let’s determine Celsius first, then Kelvin.    Let’s plug in the temperature in Fahrenheit and then rearrange the equation to solve for Celsius:           (Subtract 32 from both sides)      (Divide both sides by 1.8)   (Round to correct number of significant figures)       Now take the temperature in Celsius and plug it into the formula to solve for Kelvin:           (Round to the correct number of significant figures)     With 3 different temperature scales, it’s important to have an idea of how hot values are in each of them. You should know the following values in each unit of temperature:          Reference point  Fahrenheit  Celsius  Kelvin    Freezing point of water  32  0  273.15    Body temperature  ~98.6  ~37  ~310    Boiling point of water  212  100  373.15      Exercise 1: Energy, heat and Temperature     Do the following conversions:    17.4 J = ? kJ    16.3 J= ? cal    16.3 J= ?

Kelvin      If an object with a mass of 32kg has 72 kJ of potential energy and 65 kJ is converted into kinetic energy, how much potential energy does the object still have?    Which of the following temperatures corresponds to a patient with a fever?    37 degrees C    40 degrees C    98 degrees C    25 degrees C      Which of the following represents kinetic energy vs. potential energy?    A chemical bond linking two atoms    An atom vibrating    A molecule rotating    A person standing at the top of a staircase    A rock rolling down a hill    A car driving    The fuel in the gas tank of a car       Section 2: Food energy   When we buy food at the grocery store, it has the amount of energy that our bodies can obtain from digestion printed on the label in the form of Calories (note: that it is capitalized). This value is obtained by calculating the amount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the food. Carbohydrates and proteins both contain 4 Calories of energy for every gram. Fats, on the other hand, have more energy, containing 9 Calories in every gram (consider the 4 and 9 to be exact numbers, even though they are technically measured). If we know how many grams of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat are in a serving of food, we can calculate how many Calories it contains. See the example below:  A serving of food contains 3.0 g of carbohydrates, 5.0 g of fat, and 17 g of protein. How many Calories are in a serving?    We want to determine how many Calories come from each class of biomolecule and then add those values together to get the total.    We need to use dimensional analysis:    Carbohydrates:     Fat:     Protein:       Then add:        Exercise 2: Food energy     A serving of food has 10.0g protein, 25g carbohydrates, and 3.0 grams of fat per serving. How many Calories are in that serving? How many calories are in that serving?    A serving of food contains 17 g of fat and 45 g of carbohydrates. Are most of the Calories in that serving due to fat or carbohydrates? Explain.    A soda contains 38 g of carbohydrates per serving. A single bottle of soda contains 2.5 servings. If you consume 3 bottles of soda in a day, how many Calories are you ingesting?     Section 3: Electromagnetic radiation   When we are talking about energy in chemistry, one common way in which energy can be released or taken up by matter is in the form of electromagnetic radiation  A form of energy that can travel through space as a wave of electrical and magnetic fields . Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that can travel through space as both a wave and a particle called a photon  A massless particle of electromagnetic radiation. They are the smallest unit of electromagnetic radiation. . We all experience electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is one form of electromagnetic radiation. However, even blind people are able to experience non-visible forms of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared rays (think about how light from the sun makes things hot…a lot of this is due to infrared radiation). There are several different forms of electromagnetic radiation: gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves.  Electromagnetic radiation exists as a wave. Waves can be depicted graphically as shown below. Note the definition of a wavelength  The distance between two identical points of a wave. depicted in the drawing below. A wavelength is the distance between two identical points on different parts of the same wave. The list of forms of electromagnetic radiation listed in the paragraph above (gamma rays, x-rays, UV rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves) are arranged in order of increasing wavelengths. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths (meters or even kilometers long) and gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths (<0.01 nanometers).      The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is related to two other properties: energy and frequency  The number of waves that pass a certain point in a specific amount of time (usually 1 second) . The shorter the wavelength, the more energy that the electromagnetic radiation has. You can try to understand this by thinking about trying to vibrate a stretched out spring…you don’t have to use much energy to get the spring to vibrate slowly (long wavelengths), but you have to expend a lot of energy to get the spring to vibrate quickly (short wavelengths). An in-class demonstration can be helpful here. Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a certain point every second. Electromagnetic radiation, regardless of the type, travels with the same speed (known as the speed of light). If the waves are spaced close together, then more waves will pass by every second compared to a case where the waves are further apart. As a result, light with a long wavelength will have low frequencies. The exercises below will help you to visualize this.   Exercise 3: Electromagnetic radiation     Draw a wave with 5 wavelengths    Draw another wave with 5 shorter wavelengths and another with 5 longer wavelengths on the same sheet of paper, draw them one above the other in a stack of sorts    Hold a pencil or pen above them as a line of reference and drag your paper underneath. Which wave that you drew has waves pass the line provided by the pen\/pencil fastest.    Do longer wavelengths or shorter wavelengths of light have greater frequencies?      If light has a wavelength of 22 cm, how many meters is the wavelength?    What forms of electromagnetic radiation have energies greater than visible light? Less than visible light?    What forms of electromagnetic radiation have wavelengths longer than visible light? Shorter than visible light? Longer than microwaves? Shorter than x-rays?    What forms of electromagnetic radiation have frequencies greater than UV rays? Lower than infrared rays?

  "body": " Changes in Temperature and\/or State   Summary:     Heating and cooling    How to do calculations involving heating or cooling a substance when it does NOT change state    Uses specific heat      State changes    How to do calculations involving heating or cooling a substance when it is undergoing a change in state    Uses heat of fusion or heat of vaporization      Multistep calculations    How to do multistep calculations involving heating or cooling a substance that involve changes in state and temperature    These calculations are simply the other two types added together       Section 1: Heating and cooling   We all know that if you heat up ice it will melt. If you heat water, it will warm up and eventually will start to boil. As chemists, we can predict how much energy is needed for each of these processes. We can also predict what the effect of adding a certain amount of energy to a substance will have on its state and temperature.  When we add or remove energy from an object, this is called heat  The transfer of energy between two different objects . Addition of heat to an object causes the temperature to rise whereas the movement of heat from an object to its surroundings causes its temperature to fall. Our convention for specifying whether or not heat is moving into or from an object is to change the sign on the heat value. A negative heat value implies that the object is losing energy to its surroundings whereas a positive value indicates that heat is being transferred into the object. I like to think of the object of interest as being selfish and lazy. If heat is added, then the object is happy (plus sign) because it’s gaining. Conversely, if the object is losing heat, then that’s a negative experience as far as the object is concerned.  We can predict the relationship between the amount of heat added or removed and a corresponding temperature change by using a quantity known as specific heat  The amount of heat needed to raise 1 g of a substance by 1 degree Kelvin (or Celsius) . The specific heat of a substance is a constant that describes how much heat is required to cause a temperature change of 1 degree Kelvin to 1 g of that substance. You’ve already encountered the specific heat of water when we learned about calories (remember that 1.00 calories is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1 degree Celsius or Kelvin). Specific heat values differ between materials and also between different states of matter (ice, water, and water vapor each have different specific heat values).  Specific heat has units of . We can use specific heat as a conversion factor in calculations. We can use specific heat to calculate the amount of heat added or removed from an object if we are given the mass and temperature change. Alternatively, we can predict a temperature change if we are given the mass and amount of heat added or removed. We can also calculate the specific heat of a substance if we are given the heat, mass, and temperature change. See the examples below:  Substance E has a specific heat of 4.03 cal\/(g K). If 25 g of substance E begins at a temperature of 42.0 degrees C and 403 calories of heat is added, what will its new temperature be?    What are we being asked for: We’re asked to find the final temperature. The specific heat can be used to determine the temperature change.    Find the path: The specific heat has units of temperature in it, but also mass (grams) and heat (cal) that need to be eliminated. We’re provided the mass in grams and the heat in cal and should be able to use those values to cancel out all of the unwanted units.    Calculate:    Temperature change:   Remember that Kelvin and Celsius degrees have the same magnitude (ie. an increase of 1 degree Celsius is the same as an increase of 1 degree Kelvin) so the increase is also 4.0 degrees Celsius  New temperature: 42.0 degrees C + 4.0 degrees C = 46.0 degrees C   Exercise 1: Heating and cooling     Write a formula to calculate specific heat that includes heat (abbreviated q), mass (m), and temperature change ( ). Pay attention to the units on specific heat to guide you. If needed, how would you calculate the change in temperature? Write a version of the equation that includes the starting and ending temperatures (T 1 and T 2 ) instead of the change in temperature.    Determine the specific heat of an object if 35 cal of heat causes 22 g of the substance to increase in temperature by 4 degrees Kelvin.    Determine the specific heat of an object if 35 cal of heat causes 22 g of the substance to increase in temperature from 50.0 K to 52.1 K.    Substance X has a specific heat of 2.3 cal\/(g K). If 5.0 g of substance X receives 87 cal of heat, what is the temperature change?    Substance Y has a specific heat of 1.7 cal\/(g K). If 5.0 g of substance Y receives 87 cal of heat, what is the temperature change? Compare your answers in questions 4 and 5. Does a smaller specific heat result in a bigger or smaller temperature change when the same amount of heat is applied?    How many Calories must be removed from water to cool 17kg of it from 40.0 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees Celsius? (This is basically the same as cooling a small child who has a fever)    A 40.0g block of metal with a specific heat of 0.75 cal\/(g K) and a temperature of 75 degrees Celsius is put into 200.0 g of water at 25 degrees Celsius. What will the final temperature of the water and metal be? How much heat was transferred from the metal to the water?    The same amount of heat was added to the water as was lost by the metal. Start with your equation for specific heat and rearrange it so that you have heat= something    You have two of these equations, one for the water and one for the metal. Set them equal to one another since the heat transferred was the same (but make sure to add a negative sign to the side that corresponds to the metal, because it lost heat).    Plug in your values for the starting temperatures and specific heats and solve for the end temperature    Use the equation you made in part a to solve for the heat transferred      A 40.0g block of metal with a temperature of 75 degrees Celsius is put into 200.0 g of water at 25 degrees Celsius. The final temperature of the water and the metal is 70. degrees Celsius. What is the specific heat of the metal?    Use a similar procedure to the last problem. This time you have different information and a different unknown. Plug your values in and solve for the specific heat of the metal       Section 2: State changes   When a substance is undergoing a change in state (ex. liquid to gas) heat input or removal is often required. However, during the process of the state change, the temperature of the substance doesn’t change . For example, when ice is melting, it remains at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius until the solid has been fully converted into liquid. Once this happens, further heating will result in a temperature increase. Since there is no change in temperature involved in a state change, we need a different constant to predict how much heat will be required for these processes. For melting and for freezing, we use a constant called the heat of fusion  The amount of energy that is needed to melt 1 g of a solid into a liquid . It tells us how much energy input (or release) is required to melt (or freeze) 1 g of a substance. For changes from liquid to gas (or vice-versa) a similar constant is used that is called the heat of vaporization  The amount of energy that is needed to boil 1 g of a liquid into a gas . For changes from a solid directly to a gas (or vice-versa) a constant called the heat of sublimation  The amount of energy that is needed to sublimate 1g of a solid into a gas can be used.        The heat of fusion of water is 80. cal\/g. A hamburger contains 600. Calories. How many grams of ice could be melted at 0 degrees Celsius using the energy contained in the hamburger?    What we’re being asked for: We want the number of grams of ice that could be melted. There is a g unit in the heat of fusion; we just need to get rid of cal.    See the path: We need to get rid of cal in the heat of fusion, but we only have the 600 Calories (capitalized). If we turn the Calories into calories, then they can cancel out the units in the heat of fusion, leaving us grams.    Calculate:        Exercise 2: State changes     Come up with a formula for heat of fusion (H fusion ) that has the terms heat (q) and mass (m) in it. Would you expect the formulae for heat of vaporization and heat of sublimation to be the same or different…explain.    How much energy is needed to vaporize 23 g of water at 100. degrees Celsius? Assume that the heat of vaporization of water is 539 cal\/g.    72 cal is enough energy to melt _________g of ice at 0 degrees Celsius. Assume the heat of fusion is 80. cal\/g    Removing 72 cal from water at 0 degrees C is sufficient to freeze _________g of water into ice. Solve this one without a calculator using previous results from this exercise.     Consider the following diagram. Which portions of the graph correspond to melting and which parts correspond to boiling?     Consider the following cooling curve. Which letter represents the cooling of liquid water? Which letter(s) represent parts of the curve where liquid water is present?     Section 3: Multistep problems   Using the knowledge and skills that you practiced above we can now set about solving multistep problems that involve state changes and temperature changes. The key things to remember is that we are simply going to use the methods we’ve already learned. In order to do this, we need to treat each section of a multistep problem as its own calculation. For instance, if heat is being added to ice that is at -20 degrees C, resulting in the ice melting and becoming water at 50 degrees C, then we have to consider the following steps:    The warming of the ice to 0 degrees C    The melting of the ice at 0 degrees C    The warming of the water to 50 degrees C    42 g of ice at -20. degrees C is warmed up until it completely boils away at 100. degrees C. How much energy was added to the water throughout this process.    What are we being asked for: Find the heat for the entire process.    Find the path: We need the sum of the heats from each of the individual steps. The steps are:    Heating the ice from -20 degrees to 0 degrees C    Melting the ice at 0 degrees C    Warming the water from 0 to 100 degrees C    Boiling the water at 100 degrees C      Steps a and c are temperature increases and will use the specific heat of ice and water respectively. Steps b and d are melting and boiling and will use the heat of fusion and heat of vaporization of water respectively. We need all of those values:    Specific heat of ice: 0.490 cal\/(g K)    Specific heat of water: 1.00 cal\/(g K)    Heat of fusion of water: 80. cal\/g    Heat of vaporization of water: 539 cal\/g      Calculate:     =411.6 cal (should be rounded to tens place; but we won’t yet)   =4200 cal (should be rounded to hundreds place; but we won’t yet)   3360 cal (should be rounded to hundreds place; but we won’t yet)   =22638 cal (should be rounded to thousands place; but we won’t yet)     We use the addition rule for significant figures; we should be rounding to the thousands place.  Final answer 31000 cal (should be positive because heat was added)   Exercise 3: Multistep problems     How much heat is needed to heat 72g of water from 72 degrees Celsius and have it completely boil away at 100 degrees Celsius?    What steps are involved in this problem?    Identify each step as either a temperature change or a state change    For each of the steps, what constant do you need? A specific heat value? A heat of formation? A heat of fusion?    Do the calculations for each of the individual steps    Add the results together and round to the correct number of significant figures      Is 42000 calories enough energy to completely melt 110g of ice that begins at -30. degrees C?    What is the heat released from 205 g of steam when it begins at 100 degrees C, condenses, and eventually freezes at zero degrees C?    A patient with a mass of 75kg has a fever of 41.0 degrees C. How much ice would be needed to cool the patient to 37.0 degrees C. Assume that the patient’s body has a specific heat of 0.83 cal\/(g K) and that the water from the ice will end up with a final temperature of 37 degrees C.        Key:   Exercise 1:          0.4 cal\/(g K)    0.76 cal\/(g K)    7.6 K    10. K; smaller specific heat gives a greater temperature change    51 Cal                32 degrees C    1300 cal      45 cal\/(g K)    Exercise 2:     ; Heat of vaporization and sublimation have the same formula    12000 cal    0.90g    0.90g (freezing and melting are reversible and take the same amount of energy)    B: melting; D: boiling    C; B,C,and D have liquid water    Exercise 3:    41000 cal    A heating step and a boiling step    Temperature change and state change respectively    Specific heat of water and heat of vaporization of water                         Yes; 10400 cal needed    -147000 cal    2100 g    "

  "body": " Atoms and the Periodic Table   Summary:     Atoms and subatomic particles    Mass, charge, and location of protons, neutrons, and electrons      Atomic number and mass number    What is the meaning of these numbers    Using these numbers and the charge to determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an atom      Periodic table    How is it arranged?    Groups vs. periods    Information in a square    Information from the location of an element in the periodic table       Sections 1: Atoms and subatomic particles   All chemicals are made up of elements that are combined together. The smallest unit of an element that possesses the properties of that element is called an atom  The smallest unit of an element. . Atoms are incredibly small with sizes of approximately 0.1 nm. Numerous discoveries in physics and chemistry in the late 1800s and early 1900s revealed to scientists that there are smaller components that make up atoms which are called subatomic particles  Particles that make up an atom . The first particle to be discovered was the electron  A negatively charged particle found in the electron cloud of an atom. They have mass, but their mass is often rounded to 0 amu. . Scientists showed that electrons could be moved by electric fields, and this property was called charge. The charge of an electron was assigned a value of -1, with the understanding that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. Electrons were also found to have mass, but only a tiny percentage of the mass of an atom. Because of this, the mass of an electron is often rounded to 0 atomic mass units (amu)  Atomic mass units are units of mass that are used for very small masses like the mass of an atom. . Other important observations about electrons were that electrons could be deflected by atoms, implying that the outer part of atoms has a negative charge. This, coupled with the observation that electrons could be removed from atoms relatively easily, lead to our current understanding that electrons exist on the outside of atoms.  The next particle to be discovered were protons  Positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of approximately 1 amu. . Scientists learned that protons had considerably more mass than electrons and were assigned a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (atomic mass units are a relative scale of masses that are used primarily to describe the mass of subatomic particles). Additionally, protons were shown to have a charge of +1. Protons thus attract electrons and help to hold electrons in atoms. Additionally, it was revealed that when atoms are bombarded with positively charged particles similar to protons, that they often just passed through the atom and were only occasionally deflected. This was very different behavior than was observed for electrons. This lead to the understanding that protons occur in a small part of the atom near its center, called the nucleus  The small dense collection of protons and neutrons that is found at the center of an atom . Later experiments showed that the nucleus of an atom has protons and another subatomic particle called a neutron  An uncharged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of approximately 1 amu. . Neutrons have similar masses as protons (approximately 1 amu) but do not have any charge.   Exercise 1: Atoms and subatomic particles     Is most of the mass of the atom found in the nucleus or the electron cloud that surrounds it?    If an atom had 17 protons, 17 electrons, and 10 neutrons…    What would the mass of the atom be    How many positively charged particles are in the atom?    How many negatively charged particles are in the atom?    What is the sum of the positive and negative charges in the atom (ie. what is the net charge of the atom)?    Answer a-d for an atom with 35 protons, 34 electrons and 36 neutrons.      If the number of electrons in an atom is greater than the number of protons, then the atom will have a net ____________(positive\/negative) charge.    If an atom has a mass of 17 and contains 8 protons, how many electrons would be present if the net charge on the atom is -2?     Section 2: Atomic number and mass number   To describe the number of subatomic particles in an atom, chemists use two different numbers, atomic number and mass number. Atomic number  The number of protons in an atom. is ALWAYS equal to the number of protons in an atom. If the atom has a net charge of zero, then the atomic number will also be equal to the number of electrons. Every atom of a given element will ALWAYS have the same atomic number. The atomic number is also unique for each atom; no two elements have the same atomic number. Thus different elements can be distinguished by their number of protons.  The mass number  The sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Since protons and neutrons both have masses of approximately 1 amu, and electrons have masses of approximately 0 amu, only the protons and neutrons are counted for the mass number. For a given element, every atom will have the same number of protons, as stated in the paragraph above. However, atoms of the same element may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that have different masses (and thus different numbers of neutrons) are called isotopes  Atoms of an element that have different mass numbers . Isotopes are important in chemistry and physics not just because they have different masses, but because they may have different properties. For instance, some isotopes of an element may be stable while others may undergo radioactive decay (Chapter 5). Isotopes are often specified in one of three ways:    By writing the element name followed by a hyphen and then the mass number (ex. carbon-14)    By writing the mass number as a superscript prior to the element symbol (ex. 14 C).    By writing the mass number as a superscript prior to the element symbol along with the atomic number as a subscript prior to the element symbol (ex. )     Exercise 2: Atomic number and mass number     Come up with a formula to calculate the mass number (abbreviated A) from the number of protons and the number of neutrons    Modify your formula to calculate the mass number (A) from the atomic number (abbreviated Z) and the number of neutrons    Rearrange your equation from part a above to solve for the number of neutrons if you are given the mass number and atomic number      Why aren’t electrons counted when calculating the mass number of an isotope?    If an atom has an atomic number of 17 and a mass number of 35, how many neutrons are in the atom?    If the atom is neutral, how many electrons are in the atom?    If the atom has a charge of +3, how many electrons are in the atom?      If an atom has 32 protons, 33 electrons, and 42 neutrons, what is its mass number and charge?    What is the atomic number of an atom that contains 47 protons and 45 electrons?    An isotope with 42 neutrons and a charge of +3 has a mass number of 102. How many electron and protons are in the atom?     Section 3: Periodic table of elements   Since each atom has its own atomic number, we can arrange the elements in order of increasing atomic number. If this is done AND atoms with similar reactivity properties are placed in the same column, then the result is the modern periodic table. The periodic table was first introduced by Dmitri Mendeleev in the mid 1800s. He arranged elements by increasing mass (rather than by atomic number) and also strove to group elements with similar reactivities (similar to our current periodic table). One of the most impressive findings of his initial periodic table was that is predicted the existence of elements that were not yet known to chemists, but that are known now. Additionally, the position of elements within the periodic table allows scientists to predict how atoms will behave in certain reactions. Finally, the periodic table was useful in showing that there are patterns that predict when certain reactivity properties will occur. This pattern would later prove valuable in helping chemists understand the subatomic structural details of atoms and how it relates to reactivity (more on this in later chapters).  The periodic table contains information about every known element in squares throughout the table. The number at the top of the square is the atomic number of the element. The element name and element symbol are often given below the atomic number. In many cases, the element symbol is similar to the element name in English. In other cases, the element symbol reflects the Latin name of the element (ex. Iron’s symbol is Fe, reflecting the name ferrum in Latin). Below the element symbol is another number called the atomic mass, which will be covered in the next section. It is important to be able to distinguish between the atomic mass of an element and the mass number of an isotope.  The elements within the periodic table are organized into rows and columns. The rows are called periods  Rows in the periodic table and the columns are called groups  Columns in the periodic table. Elements in the same group usually have similar chemical and physical properties. . The periods and numbers are assigned numbers. The groups in the periodic table are numbered 1-18 left to right but are sometimes numbered in a different way in which the 8 tall column are numbered followed by the letter A, thus skipping over the shorter columns. So group 1 is also called 1A, group 2 is called 2A, and group 13 (the next tall column) is also known as group 3A. The tall “A” columns in the periodic table are referred to as the main group elements. The short columns that separate groups 2A and 3A are referred to as the transition metals. Below the periodic table are two additional rows of elements called the lanthanides and actinides, respectively. These rows would occur between groups 2 and 3 in the periodic table, but are often dropped to the bottom to save space and make sure that the periodic table isn’t too long. Since the elements in the lanthanides and actinides are relatively rare, we will not be discussing them much in this class.   Exercise 3: Periodic table of elements     What element is in…    group 2, period 3    group 4A, period 4    group 15, period 5    group 8A, period 2      What are the symbols for the following elements?

How many protons does sodium have?      How many protons, neutrons and electrons are in…    Chlorine-35     121 I     57 Fe 3+ (the 3+ written as a superscript after the element symbol indicates the charge of +3)     16 O 2-      (this atom is called an alpha particle; it’s a form of radiation that you’ll learn about in Chapter 5)      The elements sodium, calcium, copper, zinc, lead, gold, mercury, tin, aluminum, cobalt, tungsten are all metals. The elements carbon, oxygen, sulfur, chlorine, neon, radon, and iodine are all non-metals. Where do metals usually occur in the periodic table? How about non-metals?    Metals are shiny, silver in color (usually), good conductors of heat and electricity, and they’re ductile and malleable. Define ductile and malleable.

How many electrons can be fit into each shell      Orbitals    Shapes of orbitals    How many orbitals of each type are there    What orbitals are in which electron shells       Section 1: Atomic mass   At the bottom of a square in the periodic table is the value of the atomic mass  The weighted average of the masses of the isotopes found in nature. The weighting is based on the natural abundance of each isotope. in units of amu. Look at this number for carbon (12.011). This number is clearly different than the mass number since it is not an integer. However the calculation used to determine the atomic mass of an element relies on the mass numbers of the naturally occurring isotopes. To calculate atomic mass, we calculate the weighted average  A way of averaging that takes into account how frequently a value occurs in the sampling. of the various isotopes that are found in nature.  What is a weighted average? It’s a way of averaging that takes into account how frequently each isotope occurs in nature. For instance, if a class of 5 students had the following exam scores: 90, 80, 90, 90, 90 you wouldn’t simply average 80 and 90 to find the average. Instead you would add up each of the numbers (90+80+90+90+90=440) and then divide by 5. Another way of doing this is to weight each of the scores by writing how frequently it occurs:     Since 90 occurred 4 times we can multiply it by 4 and then add 80 rather than adding 90 four times. Alternatively, you could reach the same result by knowing that 20% of the class got an 80 and 80% of the class scored a 90. To use the percentages, we can assume that we have any class size, but assuming a class size of 100 people makes the calculation easiest. If we had 100 students in the class, then 20 of them would have a score of 80 and 80 of them would have a score of 90. We would multiply each score by the values of these percentages and then divide the result by the number of students that we assumed were in the class (100). The calculation would look like this and gives the exact same result:     When we calculate the atomic mass, we do a similar thing. Similar to the example above we have percent abundances for each element (ex. 20% of the isotope in the name have a certain mass number). To use percentages in a weighted average we assume that if we had 100 isotopes that that the value of the percentage is how many isotopes would have that mass. If we multiply each mass number by its percent occurrence, add then together, and then divide by 100, then we get the atomic mass. See below:  If an element has the following isotopes that are found in nature, calculate the atomic mass of the element:         Mass number  Percent abundance  Number of isotopes with that mass in a group of 100 isotopes    44  15.5  15.5    46  34.5  34.5    47  50.0  50.0     We calculate that atomic mass by taking each mass number and multiplying it by the number of isotopes of that mass that we’d expect in a group of 100 isotopes. After that we add the masses together and then divide by the total number of isotopes that we’re averaging (100).

This fact makes them the most important subatomic particle when we’re trying to understand the reactivity properties of an atom. Why? If two atoms are going to interact with one another, their electrons are going to be the type of subatomic particle that will first interact between the atoms. In order to be able to make sense of the reactivity properties of atoms, we need to understand how electrons are arranged around an atom.  Niels Bohr came up with the first model of the atom that sought to explain where the atoms are around the nucleus. His model sought to do two things: 1. To explain why negatively charged electrons don’t fall into the positively charge nucleus and 2. why hydrogen is able to emit light with very specific amounts of energy. His model proposed the idea that the electrons in an atom are placed into orbits around the nucleus (similar to satellites around Earth). If the electrons move fast enough, then they will never fall into the nucleus. Also, if we know the mass of an electron and its velocity we can calculate the amount of energy that an electron has in its orbit. Electrons in different orbits would have different velocities and thus different amounts of energy. The observation that hydrogen emits light with specific energies could be explained if electrons hopped from one orbit to another, giving off their excess energy as light.    A diagram of a group of blue dots and red dots AI-generated content may be incorrect.   How many electrons can each shell hold? Lower shell numbers are closer to the nucleus, and thus have less room for electrons than higher numbered shells. Each shell is capable of holding a certain number of electrons, and this is given by the equation:     So the first shell can hold , the 2 nd can hold , and so on.   Exercise 3: Electron shells     Electrons in ___________ (inner\/outer) shells are more easily removed from an atom.    Electrons in the 1 st shell are ________________(closer\/farther) from the nucleus than electrons in the 3 rd shell.    Explain the discovery that led scientists to develop the model of electron shells.    Determine the number of electrons in the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th shells.     Section 3: Orbitals   It was later revealed that the Bohr model was sufficient in some ways. Electron shells could explain the structure of a hydrogen atom, but failed to explain the experimental data for any other element. The reason for this is that once you have more than one electron, they begin to interact with one another. This necessitated the inclusion of orbitals  Regions of an atom where there is a high probability of finding an electron , which are regions within a shell that electrons can occupy. The idea of electron shells didn’t go away; instead the theory was modified to say that shells are more complex than originally thought. Orbitals exist within each shell and define regions where electrons are likely to be.  There are different types of orbitals, and each type is a set of different shapes that electrons can occupy. The orbital sets are given the letters: s, p, d, and f (see the following link to see their shapes: https:\/\/www.sciencefacts.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Atomic-Orbital.jpg ). S-orbitals are spherical in shape and occur around the nucleus. P-orbitals come in sets of 3, and each member of the set looks like a dumbbell or infinity symbol. D-orbitals come in sets of 5, with most of them looking like clovers. F-orbitals come in sets of 7 and have even more complicated shapes. You should be able to recognize and draw the s, p, and d orbital shapes and you should know how many come in a set.  So how do orbitals relate to shells? First of all, you need to know that orbitals can hold 2 electrons. The s-orbital comes in groups of 1, and thus that single orbital in the set can hold 2 electrons. Each of the p-orbitals in a set of 3 can hold 2 electrons, for a total of 6 electrons. Each of the d-orbitals holds 2 electrons and since they come in sets of 5, a set of d-orbitals holds 10 electrons. Now let’s go back to the shells. The first shell holds 2 electrons based on the formula given above. The only set of orbitals that can give two electrons is the s-orbital. So the first shell only contains one s-orbital and it is designated as the 1s orbital (meaning first shell s-orbital). The second shell contains 8 electrons. No set of orbitals by itself can give us 8 electrons, but the combination of a set of s-orbitals and p-orbitals can together hold 8 electrons (2 electrons from the s-orbital and 6 from the three p-orbitals). So the 2 nd shell has a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. In order to get 18 electrons for the third shell, we need a 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and five 3d orbitals. For the fourth shell a 4s orbital, three 4p orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and seven 4f orbitals are required. Hopefully you’re noticing a pattern. The 5 th shell and up should require additional orbital types, but there are no known elements that require orbitals beyond the f-orbitals. The table below summarizes this information.          Shell  Number of electrons  Orbital types  Number of electrons in the set of orbitals    1  2  1s  2    2  8  2s  2      2p, 2p, 2p  6    3  18  3s  2      3p, 3p, 3p  6      3d, 3d, 3d, 3d, 3d  10    4  32  4s  2      4p, 4p, 4p  6      4d, 4d, 4d, 4d, 4d  10      4f, 4f, 4f, 4f, 4f, 4f, 4f  14    5  50  5s  2      5p, 5p, 5p  6      5d, 5d, 5d, 5d, 5d  10      5f, 5f, 5f, 5f, 5f, 5f, 5f  14       ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?

Exercise 3: Electron shells and orbitals     Without consulting the table above, what orbitals are in the first shell, 2 nd shell, 3 rd shell, and 4 th shell?    How many electrons are in the 3 rd shell? How many orbitals are needed to hold that number of electrons? How can you get that number of orbitals by combining together different orbital sets?    How many electrons can a single 4p orbital hold? How many electrons can the set of 4p orbitals hold? How many electrons can a single 5d orbital hold? How about the set of 5d orbitals?    Which orbital type has a shape similar to a ball? An hour-glass? A four-leaf clover?    For the table above, make a 6 th row and fill in the missing information.

  "body": " Electron arrangement   Summary:     Electron configuration of an atom    Periodic table is arranged into blocks corresponding to the type of orbitals being filled      Valence electrons    How to figure out the number of valence electrons in an atom    Stable configurations       Section 1: Electron configurations and valence electrons   Now that we know where we can put electrons in an atom, we can start to fill these orbitals with the number of electrons that an atom has. In general the order that we fill will proceed from the lowest shell number to the highest because lower shell numbers have lower energy than higher shell numbers (making filling them preferable…here’s an analogy, is it easier to put a bowling ball on the floor at the bottom of a set of stairs or to carry it up and put it on the top step…similarly nature prefers lower energy states to higher states.  Way number 1 to figure out the filling order:    Make a diagram listing all of the possible orbitals as shown below (one of the exercises will have you practice making this drawing)          Begin drawing diagonal lines starting at the top. The order that you draw through the diagonal lines is the order that the orbitals get filled          Figure out the order: 1s<2s<2p<3s<3p<4s<3d<4p<5s<4d<5p<6s…    Before I show you the other way to find the orbital filling order, it’ll be helpful to start filling these orbitals with electrons. We have to remember that each orbital holds 2 electrons and that s-orbitals come in groups of 1, p’s in groups of 3, d’s in groups of 5, and f’s in groups of 7. This means that s-orbitals hold up to 2 electrons, p’s up to 6, d’s up to 10, and f’s up to 14. We’ll start simple with hydrogen. A neutral hydrogen atom only has one electron (given by it’s atomic number of 1). That electron will be placed in the lowest energy orbital (the 1s). We denote the number of electrons in a set of orbitals with a superscript after the orbital. So hydrogen has the electron configuration . For an atom of helium, we have two electrons. The 1s orbital can hold two electrons, so it’s configuration is . For lithium, we have 3 electrons, this additional electron needs to go into the next lowest orbital so its configuration is . Similarly beryllium is . After this, we have boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon with electron configurations of , , , and respectively. With larger and larger elements, the electron configurations get longer and longer to write out. Thankfully we have an abbreviated way of accomplishing this which is shown in the box below, along with another way of figuring out the orbital filling order:  The position of an element in the periodic table can tell us the orbital and shell numbers that are being filled as shown below:      Using this diagram we can fill the electron configuration of any atom. In the first row, we’re crossing the s-block, so those electrons go into the 1s orbital. The first two elements in the 2 nd row will have additional electrons in their 2s orbital (because they are in the s-block) then the next 6 will have their additional electrons put in the 2p orbitals. Next comes 3s and 3p with the elements in the 3 rd row. In the 4 th row, we cross the s block (4s), then the d-block (3d; note that the d shell number is always one less than the row number), then the 4p. To abbreviate long electron configurations, the noble-gas shorthand is used. When doing this, we proceed BACKWARDS to the nearest noble gas and write its symbol in brackets to indicate that this element has the same electron configuration as that noble gas, plus the extra orbitals that we’ll soon indicate. We then add on the additional orbitals and electrons from the row that the element we’re interested is in. So for potassium (K), if we back up to the nearest noble gas, we find argon. The additional electrons for potassium are in the 4 th row. There is only 1 additional electron in the s-block so the electron configuration is . Similarly, for cadmium, we’d back up to find krypton. The additional electrons (12 of them) are in the 5 th row and we have to cross the s and d blocks. So the electron configuration would be .   Exercise 1: Electron configurations     Recreate the drawing in the table above that illustrates the orbital filling order. Then do it a second time on a clean sheet of paper, trying to create it from memory.    Try to add more arrows than the arrows shown in the diagram provided. What orbital gets filled after the 6d orbital      What orbital gets filled after the:    3s    2p    5s    4p    4d      Write the electron configuration for the following atoms in both long form and using the noble gas shorthand    P    Se    Ni    Al    Mg       Section 2: Valence electrons   The noble gas shorthand does a good job of emphasizing the electrons that are in the outermost shell (highest number shell) of the atom. These electrons are called valence electrons  Electrons that are in the outermost (or highest energy) electron shell of an atom. . They are very important because if two atoms come together to react with one another, the outer most electrons are the ones that are going to be controlling how they interact. We can find the number of electrons from the electron configuration quite easily. Take carbon for example. Its electron configuration is or . There are 4 electrons in the 2 nd shell (the highest numbered shell for carbon), so it has 4 valence electrons. Silicon, which is in the same group and has similar reactivity properties has the electron configuration and thus also has 4 valence electrons. We can figure out the number of valence electrons from the electron configuration, but we can figure them out even easier for the main group elements (ie. those elements in the tall columns) by simply looking at the main group number. Carbon is in group 4A and thus has 4 valence electrons. Fluorine is in group 7A and thus has 7 valence electrons.  Thus, every element in a particular group (at least in the main group; we won’t worry about the transition metals for this part) of the periodic table will have the same number of valence electrons. Recall that elements in the same group in the periodic table have similar chemical and physical properties. The reason for this is that every element in a group has the name number of valence electrons. This can also highlight particularly stable and unstable arrangements of electrons. Answer the exercise questions to shed some light on this.   Exercise 2: Valence electrons     How many valence electrons do the following elements have?    Mg    H    S    Br    Xe      The noble gases are in group 8A. The noble gases are known for being very stable; it’s extremely difficult to make them react with anything else.    How many valence electrons do the noble gases have (with the exception of helium)?    This number of valence electrons is therefore particularly __________ (stable\/unstable).      The alkali metals are in group 1. They react violently when placed into water.    How many valence electrons do they have?    Is this number of electrons stable or unstable?    If sodium loses one electron:    What would its electron configuration be?    How many valence electrons would it now have?    Would you expect it to be more stable or less stable?    What would the charge be on the new sodium ion?        The halogens are in group 7A. They react violently with many compounds, especially metals.    How many valence electrons do they have?    Is this number of electrons stable or unstable?    If chlorine gains one electron:    What would its electron configuration be?    How many valence electrons would it now have?    Would you expect it to be more stable or less stable?    What would the charge be on the new chlorine ion?

Radiation is the emission of energy from an object in the form of electromagnetic radiation (which we covered previously) or in the form of parts of atoms. Importantly, radiation doesn’t imply a specific cause for the energy emission. Radioactivity produces radiation, but from a very specific source. In radioactivity, an atom has an unstable nucleus, and that nucleus becomes stable, and in the process releases radiation. There are other sources of radiation other than radioactivity. Radioactivity will always produce radiation.  Now that we’ve clarified those two terms, let’s begin to learn about radioactivity in more detail. In the last chapter, we learned about isotopes. To review, isotopes are atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons and thus different mass numbers. Some isotopes of atoms are stable, whereas other isotopes have unstable nuclei. These nuclei can stabilize themselves by emitting energy or particles. This is called radioactive decay. Radioactive decay causes that isotope to emit radiation. The radiation that is emitted can be different for different isotopes. forms that we’ll be learning about, because of their relevance to medicine are gamma radiation, beta particles, alpha particles, neutrons, protons, and positrons.  What are these different forms of radiation. We’ve previously learned about gamma rays. Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation or light energy. Out of the different forms of electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays have the highest energies. The other forms of radiation that we’re going to cover are particles. It’s often helpful to group the particles together based on their similarities and differences.  Some radioactive isotopes emit gamma radiation . This emission is in the form of a photon (or light) that has energy of a gamma ray. The emission of a gamma ray is caused by an unstable nucleus relaxing to a lower energy state and emitting the lost energy as light. Unlike the other types of radioactive emission, gamma rays are massless and lack charge.  Other types of radioactive isotopes decay and emit particles. These types of particles are alpha particles, beta particles, positrons, protons, and neutrons. These particles vary in their mass and charge. Alpha particles have the greatest mass. They are essentially a helium atom nucleus. They consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons that are fused together into the largest of the particles that we’ll discuss. Beta particles are essentially electrons that are ejected from an atoms as a part of radioactive emission. However, they are ejected from the nucleus rather than from the cloud of electrons around the atom (we’ll discuss how this works more in the next section). Positrons are antimatter particles. They have the same mass as an electron, but they’re positively charged. When antimatter positrons collide with electrons, they annihilate one another and their mass is turned into energy in the form of gamma rays. We’ve already discussed protons and neutrons. Their masses and charges are the same that we’ve previously discussed, even when they are ejected from an atom as a part of radioactive decay.   Exercise 1:     Do the following particles have mass? If they do, round their mass to the nearest amu.    Gamma ray    Beta-particle    Proton    Alpha particle    Neutron    Positron      What is the charge of the following particles?    Gamma ray    Beta-particle    Proton    Alpha particle    Neutron    Positron      How many protons and neutrons are in the following nuclei?    Cobalt-57    Uranium-238    Fluorine-18       Balancing decay reactions   When radioactive decay occurs, changes happen to the radioactive atom. In most cases, the emission of the radiation results in a change in the nucleus of the atom and can even change one element into another element. To describe the changes that take place after radioactive decay, we can write a radioactive decay equation. The guiding principle when writing a radioactive decay equation is that the total mass and total charge cannot change after the decay has occurred.  The first type of decay equation that we’ll explore is gamma decay. Unlike other forms of radioactivity, there is no change in the composition of the nucleus. Instead the nucleus simply changes from a high energy state (called a metastable state) to a low energy state. This makes balancing nuclear decay equations that involve gamma emission very easy. See the example below:     In this equation, the superscript m indicates that the nucleus of iodine-125 is metastable (semi-stable\/unstable). The Greek letter gamma is used to represent the emitted gamma ray.  Two other types of radioactivity (which are quite similar) are beta particles and positrons. Beta particles and positrons are both particles that are emitted from the nucleus. Both of them have mass (although it is very small and often rounded to 0 amu, similar to an electron). Also, both beta particles and positrons have charge; beta particles are negatively charged while positrons are positively charged. When nuclei emit a particle that has charge, the remaining charge in the nucleus has to change; the charge that is emitted has to come from somewhere (it isn’t simply created). This results in the nucleus having the same mass, but a different number of protons. When the number of protons changes, the identity of the atom actually changes from one element to another. See the examples below:              Equation 1 represents a beta-particle emission. The symbol represents the beta-particle and implies that it has 0 mass and an atomic number (or charge, since we’re focusing solely on the nucleus) of -1. Sometimes beta-particles are represented in other ways, such as or , but they mean the exact same thing. Equation 2 represents a positron emission with the representing the positron (other times it may be represented by or ). Note that in both cases, the identity of the isotope changes after the particle is emitted. This is because nuclear decay equations must balance both charge and mass on both sides of the equation. Since beta-particles and positrons lack mass, the mass number of the resulting isotope remains the same as it was in the beginning (in equation 1 the mass is 3 before and after emission; in equation 2, the mass is 18 before and after emission). Now let’s talk about how we figure out the atomic number of the resulting isotope. First, recall that the atomic number of an atom is ALWAYS the number of protons in the nucleus. Since protons are positively charged, the atomic number also ALWAYS gives us the charge of the nucleus of an atom. So, in equation 1, the nucleus of hydrogen began with a charge of +1. Since a beta particle was emitted, and since it has a charge of -1 then the resulting nucleus must have a charge of +2 (because +2 +(-1)= +1). We can figure this out by making a simple equation that states that the charge on the left equals the charge on the right:     We can do the same for positron emission in equation 2:     Once we know the atomic number of the resulting isotope (2 or 8 respectively in the examples above), then we can figure out which element they represent (He and O respectively).  So how do positron and beta-particle emissions work? How is the number of protons changing? When a beta-particle is emitted, a neutron is actually changing into a beta-particle plus a proton. The negative charge of the beta particle balances out the positive charge of the proton, hence why they both come from a neutral particle. So every time a beta-particle is emitted the mass remains the same (because protons and neutrons have masses of 1 amu), but the number of protons increases by one and the number of neutrons decreases by one. When a positron is emitted, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron. Thus a proton is lost, and the atomic number decreases by one, but a new neutron appears to preserve the mass.  Another type of radioactivity is an alpha particle. Alpha particles have mass and charge, specifically a mass of 4 amu and a charge of +2. They are therefore the same as a helium nucleus. When we are balancing a nuclear decay equation involving alpha particle emission, we need to make sure to balance both mass and charge. See the example below:         Note that the mass numbers are balanced on both sides of the reaction arrow as are the atomic numbers (or nuclear charge). The alpha particle is denoted in equation 3.  Finally, radioactive decay can result in the ejection of protons or neutrons from the nucleus. When a proton decay occurs a particle is ejected. When neutron decay occurs the ejected particle is . The rules for writing the decay equations for other types of particles still applies in these cases. We simply need to ensure that the total nuclear charge is the same on both sides of the equation AND that the mass is the same on both sides of the equation as well.   Exercise 2:      Write a balanced nuclear decay equation for the following:      The beta decay of carbon-14      The alpha decay of radon-220      The gamma decay of cobalt-60      The positron emission of magnesium-23      The neutron emission of krypton-87      The proton emission of cobalt-47        What type of radiation is emitted in the following processes:      The conversion of metastable Tc-99 to stable Tc-99      The conversion of carbon-11 to boron-11      Polonium-210 changing to lead-206                       What type(s) of radioactive emission…      involves particles with non-negligible masses      produces a positively charge particle      causes the nucleus to increase in atomic number by 1      causes the nucleus to decrease in atomic number by 1      increases the number of neutrons in the nucleus      decreases the number of neutrons in the nucleus      causes no change in the identity of the element        Section 3: Uses of radioactive materials   Radioactive materials have numerous uses in energy production, science, and medicine. We’ll cover a few as a part of this section.  Nuclear power plants rely on isotopes that undergo neutron decay to initiate a process called nuclear fission . Nuclear fission is a different type of nuclear decay in which a nucleus splits. This splitting is caused by the impact of a high energy neutron (which is produced by neutron decay) on a nucleus. The impact results in an unstable nucleus that undergoes nuclear fission. When a nucleus splits, smaller nuclei are produced along with other neutrons. These neutrons can impact the nuclei of other atoms causing them to undergo nuclear fission. This leads to a chain reaction where the splitting of one nucleus leads to particles that can cause the splitting of other nuclei. Every time a nucleus undergoes fission, some of the mass of the nucleus is turned into energy. This energy can be used to heat water to a boil and the resulting steam can be used to turn a turbine and produce electricity.  Nuclear power can produce vast amounts of power without the production of greenhouse gases. However, nuclear power generates a large amount of radioactive waste. The nuclei that are produced after fission are often radioactive themselves. This presents a challenge for us to figure out ways to safely store these waste products. In addition, the radioactive materials that are needed to cause the chain reactions (namely uranium-235) are a limited resource that requires a lot of effort to mine and purify.  Radioactive isotopes are used in medicine as tracers or as therapeutics. Tracers are chemicals that can help doctors pinpoint the location of problems. In a PET scan, for instance, a patient is treated with isotopes that emit positrons. When positrons are emitted in the human body, they are quickly annihilated by the electrons in the surrounding tissues. This annihilation produces gamma rays that can be detected by specialized cameras. This allows doctors to detect the location of the positron emitting isotopes in the human body. For example, PET scans can be used to detect tumors. In this usage, the patient is fed radioactive sugar. Cancer cells take up sugar much more quickly than most tissues in the human body. As a result the radioactive isotopes accumulate in the tumor and begin emitting more positrons there. By detecting the resulting gamma rays, doctors can easily detect the precise location of a tumor.  Another medical use of radioactive materials is in radiation therapy. In radiation therapy, radioactive materials are placed in or near a tumor. Radiation can impact the tumor, leading to destruction of the molecules in those cells and ultimately the death of those cells. Unfortunately the damage is hard to confine to the tumor, and often surrounding tissues are damaged in the process, resulting in side effects.   Exercise 3:      Explain how a chain reaction is used to produce nuclear power.      Why are gamma ray cameras used to detect positrons in a PET scan?      How do doctors get cancer cells to accumulate radioactive materials prior to a PET scan?      Which type of radiation do you think would be more damaging to tissues, an alpha particle or a beta-particle? Why?         Key   Exercise 1    Do the following particles have mass? If they do, round their mass to the nearest amu.    No    Yes, 0 amu    Yes, 1 amu    Yes, 4 amu    Yes, 1 amu    Yes, 0 amu      What is the charge of the following particles?    0    -1    +1    +2    0    +1      How many protons and neutrons are in the following nuclei?    27 protons 30 neutrons    92 protons 146 neutrons    9 protons 9 neutrons      Exercise 2:                                        Gamma    Positron    Alpha    Beta    Proton    neutron        Alpha, proton, neutron    Positron, proton, and alpha    Beta    Positron, proton    Positron    Beta, neutron, and alpha    Gamma and neutron      Exercise 3:     A neutron impacts a nucleus of one atom, leading to nuclear fission and energy release. This fission releases more neutrons. These neutrons can impact other nuclei causing them to similarly undergo fission and release energy      Positrons annihilate when they encounter electrons in the atoms surrounding the positron emitters. This annihilation releases energy in the form of gamma rays      Radioactive sugar is given to the patient. Cancer cells take up and use sugar quicker than other types of tissues because they are actively growing.      Alpha particles have a greater impact because of their larger charge.     "

Radioactivity has the potential to cause chemical changes to our cells which can lead to cell death, mutations, and cancer. One of the easiest ways to minimize our risk is to use the lowest amount of radioactive isotope possible. The question then arises…how do we measure radioactivity. Radioactivity can be measured by a variety of devices, depending on the type of emission. In all cases, the SI unit that is used to measure radioactivity is a becquerel (abbreviated Bq), which is the same as one radioactive decay (or disintegration) every second. The nuclei of a radioactive isotope will randomly decay, releasing radioactivity. If a sample contains more nuclei or is more enriched in radioactive nuclei (ie. there are more radioactive nuclei and fewer non-radioactive nuclei) then the sample will produce more radiation every second, leading to a higher Bq value. Another historically important unit of measure for radioactivity is a Curie (abbreviated Ci). A Curie is a much larger quantity than a becquerel and represents 3.7 x10 10 decays per second or that same number of becquerels. A Curie often represents a very large amount of radiation, so it’s common for laboratory personnel to use smaller metric prefixes along with Curies, such as mCi or µCi.  The units of Curies and becquerels are used to describe how much radiation an object emits. The emission of radioactivity from an object moves in all directions, and thus a large percentage of that radiation may never enter the body of a patient or medical professional. To describe the amount of radiation that actually enters the body, scientists use a different unit called a rad . This unit has since been replaced by the SI unit of grey ( abbreviated Gy; one Gy is the same as 100 rad).  To quantify the damaging effects of absorbed radiation, scientists use the unit rem (radiation equivalent in man). Rem can be easily calculated from rad by multiplying it by a damage factor that is specific to the type of radioactive particle that’s being absorbed. In general, gamma rays, beta particles, and positrons cause the least amount of damage (and thus have a factor of 1), protons and neutrons cause moderate damage (and have a factor of 10), and alpha particles cause the most damage (and have a factor of 20). Another unit that is used to measure the effect of absorbed radiation is a Sievert (abbreviated Sv) . One Sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. How much radiation is too much? An average person receives about 3 mSv of radiation per year. A single x-ray or a CT scan subject a person to 0.1-10 mSv of radiation. At a dose of 50 mSv, there is a statistically detectable increase in a person’s cancer risk. Radiation sickness can begin to set in with doses of 0.5 Sv (notice the change from mSv with the previous doses). A dose of 3-4 Sv is generally fatal to ~50% of people who receive that high of a dose.   Exercise 1:     Convert 18 Ci to Bq    Convert 5.3 x 10 8 Bq to mCi.    Which sample is more radioactive, one with 4.3 µCi or one with 5.77 x 10 5 Bq?    Describe the difference between rad, Bq, and rem in terms of what they are measuring.    If a patient receives a dose of 54.3 rad of alpha particles…    How many Gy did they receive?    What is the biological impact of the radiation in units of rem?    What is the biological impact of the radiation in units of Sv?    Would you expect the person who received the dose in c to survive or be sick?    Recalculate b and c if the radiation was beta-particles instead.       Radiation safety   Radiation can pose safety risks to humans, but if users are careful, the health impacts can be minimized. In order to avoid harm from radiation, there are 3 things to consider:    Amount of radiation used    Time    Distance    Shielding    Whenever radioactive materials or other radiation sources are used, we should be careful to use the least amount possible. As you’d expect, by using lower amounts of radioactive materials, we can lessen the total exposure to radiation as well as the total amount of possible damage.  Likewise, biological damage from radiation can be lessened by spending the minimal amount of time in an environment with a radiation source. In general, the more time a person spends near a radiation source, the greater their exposure to radiation and therefore the greater the amount of biological damage that will occur.  Another important consideration is the distance between the radioactive material (or radiation source) and the person being exposed. There is a mathematical relationship between the amount of radiation a person’s body absorbs and the distance from the radiation source. The intensity of radiation decreases by the square of the distance increase from the radiation source. If you are standing 2 m from a radiation source, you would receive ¼ the radiation exposure that you would receive if you were standing 1 m away. This is because the same amount of radiation becomes spread over a larger area as the distance increases. The impact of distance on radiation intensity is described by the inverse square law equation:     Where and are the radiation intensities at the first ( ) and second ( ) distances respectively.  Finally, various forms of radiation can be blocked by different types of shielding. In general, the larger the particle and more charged it is, the less shielding required. Alpha particles, the most massive radioactive particles, can be blocked by a sheet of paper or by our outer layer of skin. For alpha particle emitters to cause biological damage, they must typically be ingested or incorporated into the body by some other means. Beta-particles can be shielded by about a centimeter of aluminum, plastic, or plexiglass. Neutrons (no charge) and gamma rays (no mass or charge) are much more difficult to shield. Radioactive sources that emit these forms of radiation often require lead or concrete shielding to block exposure.   Exercise 2:     List the 4 ways that we can help lessen our exposure to radiation when working with radioactive materials    What type of radiation is the easiest to block with shielding? Which types are the hardest to block?    Think about what you know about the mass and charge of each of the types of radiation. How does that information relate to how easy it is to block that type of radiation?    A person would be exposed to 4.0 mGy of radiation if they were 10.0 m from the radiation source. How much radiation would they be exposed to if they were instead:    20.0 m from the radiation source    100. m from the radiation source    2.5 m from the radiation source      Rearrange the equation below to solve for :         Use the rearranged equation in question 5 to answer the following question: A worker needs to keep their radiation exposure below 5.0 mGy. If they would be exposed to 15 mGy of radiation at a distance of 2.5 m, what is the closest they can get to the radiation source without exceeding their maximum dose?     Half-life on radioisotopes   Radioactive isotopes decay in a random fashion. As they decay, the atoms in the sample change and the sample can gradually lose its radioactive properties, simply because there is less and less of the original radioactive isotope left. We measure the decay rate of radioactive isotopes using half-lives. One half life is the amount of time required to have the decay rate of a substance decrease by a factor of one-half. So after one half life, half of the original isotope remains and the decay rate will thus be ½ of what it originally was. After a second half life has passed, one-half of one-half of the original radioactive isotope will remain (or ¼). After each subsequent half-life the amount of original radioactive isotope will again decrease by ½. We can use this information to derive a formula to calculate the amount of radioactive isotope or the decay rate after a given amount of time has passed:     In this formula is the decay rate or amount of isotope at time t and is the original rate or amount. The variables and represent the time that has passed and the half-life of the isotope respectively. So if we began with 17 mCi of radioactive material that has a half-life of 8 days and 30 days have passed, we’d have mCi of radioactive material left. Half lives of isotopes can vary dramatically with short ones having half-lives of seconds or minutes and long ones having half-lives of thousands of years. Isotopes that are used clinically generally have short half-lives (on the order of days or weeks) because that means that they will decay at a fast rate meaning that they can produce their useful radiation dose more quickly with less material required.   Exercise 3:      After 5 half lives, what fraction of the original radioactive material will remain?      How about after 7 half-lives?        After 4 half-lives what percentage of the original radioactive material will remain? Round to 3 significant figures      If 28.5 mg of radioactive material with a half live of 17 days is allowed to decay for 8 days, then how much will remain? Round to 3 significant figures      5.2 x 10 7 Bq of radioactive material is purchased. It has a half life of 23 hours. After exactly 7 days, how much radioactive material will remain? Round to 2 significant figures      A lab orders 16 mCi of radioactive material. After 8 days, 2.0 mCi remains. What is the half life of the material? Round to the nearest tenth of a day.
