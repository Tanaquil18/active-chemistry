  "title": "Purpose",
  "body": "Purpose  This textbook is intended for collegiate pre-nursing students as a part of a two semester course in General, Organic, and Biological chemistry. The first ten chapters of this text is also appropriate for high school students as a first chemistry course and pairs with the Franciscan Advantage program in chemistry that is offered by Franciscan University of Steubenville.  I believe that this textbook is unique in that it pairs active-learning in chemistry with a Catholic-Christian understanding of science and chemistry. Active learning is an educational term that encompasses many different approaches, but importantly means that the student is actively engaged in learning rather than listening to lectures.  This textbook is divided into chapters. Each chapter is further divided into lessons (which are appropriate for a 50 min college class or perhaps several days worth of a high school class). Within each lesson are several sections, each of which teaches a different concept. The sections contain a text lesson, which should ideally be read by the student before class. Each section ends with several exercises which are designed to be completed during class, with the help of peers or the instructor. Studies have repeatedly shown that students learn better and retain knowledge better when they are actively engaged in learning new material rather than simply having it presented to them.  This text also aims to incorporate a Catholic-Christian understanding of science, philosophy, and ethics. The first chapter of the textbook focuses heavily on this, but there are additional places throughout the textbook where the relevance of the lesson to our faith and morals is discussed further.  To further aid in student learning, this textbook includes helpful online video instruction to accompany the various chapters and lessons in the textbook. These videos are freely available on YouTube, and teachers and students are encouraged to utilize them where they deem appropriate.  "

  "title": "Learning in an Active Classroom",
  "body": "Learning in an Active Classroom  This textbook is designed for use in an Active Learning environment. This may be different than other classes that you’re used to taking in that there is substantially less lecturing from your instructor and more emphasis on you learning by actively participating in the learning process. This requires that you listen and take notes when your instructor is teaching, just as you would in any class. Even more important, though, is that you complete all of the exercises in this text. These should be completed before you go on to the next section, since much of science builds upon prior knowledge and skills.  When completing the exercises, you should be aware of the following guidelines:   Always WRITE down your responses to each question and include any work. If you struggled with this problem, your work should include notes to help you remember how you solved the problem. Writing helps you commit your responses to memory and provides an invaluable study aid for quizzes and\/or exams.    If you are struggling with a problem, first ask your group for help. If your group cannot solve the problem, ask your instructor for help. Reaching out for help is an essential skill in an active learning environment and throughout life!    Always make sure to check your answer with the key in the textbook. Everyone makes mistakes! The only way to correct them is to know that you made a mistake in the first place.    If you get help, write down notes about the help you receive!    Do not skip or ignore any exercise problem. They are all there for a reason!    Don’t be afraid to struggle! There’s no shame in not understanding something. The real failure is if you give up.     In an active learning classroom group work is highly encouraged. Not only does it give you an opportunity to help others, but it strengthens learning by requiring you to be able to explain the concepts that you’re learning about. Also, if you are the one who is having to ask the questions, forming fraternal bonds with your classmates can help you through your struggles in a class and ensure that you always have multiple sources of help available to you. On the other hand, if you’re the one explaining a concept to a fellow group member, make sure that they understand what you are saying and be patient with them if they continue to struggle. It’s all too common to have a student respond “Oh I get it now” when they don’t fully grasp what you said. Don’t be afraid to struggle!  Group work can have pitfalls if you don’t utilize it properly. It’s the responsibility of each member of the group to contribute to the exercises, to ensure that they understand the material being covered, and to ensure that their fellow group members understand the material. If you don’t understand a concept, keep asking for help until you do. Don’t just rush through the exercises and assume that because the group got the answers right that you also understand the concept or how to solve the problem. Again, don’t be afraid to struggle!   Exercise: Learning in an active classroom     Write down the 6 guidelines to completing exercises in an active classroom. Why is each one of these guidelines important?    Introduce yourself to your group members (no need to write anything down for this one, unless you want to). Suggested information includes your name, hometown, major, hobbies, etc. You may find yourself in a different group from time-to-time. Always take time to introduce yourself to people who are new to you and to learn about them as well. If you’re completing this course on your own (ex. in a homeschool environment), make sure to find someone knowledgeable in chemistry who you can reach out to. Also you can always reach out to the author, Dr. James Vranish, by emailing him at jvranish@franciscan.edu .      "

  "title": "Relationship between the natural and the supernatural",
  "body": " Relationship between the natural and the supernatural   Summary:     What is meant by the natural and supernatural    The existence of the natural world is dependent on a supernatural cause    Christians hold the natural and supernatural to both be important     Natural and the Supernatural:   In this textbook, I’m going to be assuming that the reader acknowledges the existence of the Christian God and His Son, Jesus Christ. My discussions of faith, science, and ethics will come from the theological tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, but will have a lot in common with other Christian denominations. If there are areas in the text that seem to be at odd with your own personal beliefs, I hope the information contained in here can serve as a starting point for further discussions and debates.  Catholics acknowledge Jesus and thus can’t separate their discussions of the natural world from the supernatural (bolded text is usually indicating an important term that you SHOULD know the definition of. In this textbook, definitions and extra commentary are provided by clicking on the word). Both the natural and supernatural are components of reality and are interdependent. Catholics acknowledge the existence of God, and thus existence that is beyond nature, in other words, the supernatural. As St. Thomas Aquinas argues in his Summa Theologica , the creation of the natural world presupposes a supernatural cause; nature cannot be the first cause. He argues this at length through the “first mover” argument. In this argument he establishes that the natural world is dependent on God for its existence. This argument goes something like this:    The natural world is full of motion. Matter moves, time moves, etc.    All motion must have a prior cause.    Natural things have the potential to move, that is they have potency That potential can be realized through the action of some outside cause. Natural things also have actuality , the ability to bring forth potency (ie. natural things can cause other natural things to move). The bringing forth of potency is a change in that thing.    There must be a first actuality to bring forth all motion. That actuality can’t have potency, otherwise it would have had to be acted on by something else first. We can summarize this by saying that there must be a “first mover”.    There is a philosophical need for an actor that can actualize motion but remain unchangeable. We call this actor God. God must therefore lack potency (He doesn’t change). Instead, God is pure actuality ( Actus Purus ). He can initiate change or motion but can’t be acted upon or changed by other things.    Actus purus must initiate all motion. Therefore God must have initiate all of nature.    After having established the existence of the supernatural in addition to the natural world, many questions arise about the importance of each and the relationship between them (example: miracles). In many ways, the Catholic faith is grounded in the supernatural. God has a supernatural nature and is both the Creator and Redeemer. Humanity is dependent on Him for existence, and the hope for eternal life rests solely in Him. Because of the supremacy of God’s supernatural nature, one might argue that the best thing that each of us can do with our lives is to put all of effort into understanding the supernatural, thus minimizing the importance of the material world. Indeed portions of scripture could be interpreted as saying that this is the approach that Catholics should take. Two examples:    “Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”  1 John 2:15      “’Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?  Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?  Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?  Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.  But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.  If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?  So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’  All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.  But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.”  Matthew 6: 25-33.    So, should we all study theology and scorn the study of the natural world? Hopefully it is obvious to you that this view is incomplete and thus misguided…but why?     Summarize the first mover argument in your own words.      Answers may vary (see the argument in the text to check for similarity to what you stated).        Explain the terms potency, actuality, and Actus Purus in your own words. What is the relationship between the three terms?      Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. Potency is some change that can be realized in a thing. Actus Purus is a term for God that describes Him as pure actuality without potency. Actuality brings forth potency. The first actualization must have been from Actus Purus.        Would most superheroes be best classified as natural or supernatural? They are clearly exceptional, but are they supernatural?      They are exceptional but natural. They can be seen and touched. Their powers often work within nature (example: spiderman can only swing because of his webs).        Are angels natural or supernatural? Do angels possess potency, actuality, or both?      Angels are supernatural (example: they donâ€™t exist in one particular space; their movement defies the laws of physics). Angels can change and therefore possess potency. They can also influence other things and thus have actuality.        Is everything that is supernatural Actus Purus?      Angels are an example of something that is supernatural that nonetheless possesses potency. Only God is Actus Purus.        As Catholics, we believe that God is not exclusively supernatural. We believe that Jesus is the unity of the supernatural and the natural in one person. How does this knowledge inform the way in which we should approach the relationship between the natural and the supernatural as Catholics? Is one more important than the other?      Human nature and human bodies are a part of God, through his Son, Jesus. God is therefore body and spirit, natural and supernatural. If we are to love God, we must love both parts. In caring for others, we must care for their bodily and spiritual needs.        Catholics are called to be separate from the world, yet we are material creatures. What are ways in which we can practically abandon materialism?      When we say we should abandon materialism, we mean that we should abandon unhealthy attachments. For instance, food is good, but gluttony is sinful. We can avoid gluttony by practicing occasional fasting.       "

  "title": "Catholicism vs. superstition",
  "body": " Catholicism vs. superstition   Summary:     Catholicism is not superstitious    Superstition seeks to use the supernatural to achieve control    Catholicism recognizes that God is always in control     Catholicism vs. superstition   A common argument against Catholicism and Christianity is that it is nothing but superstition . In doing so, they are trying to equate our faith with paganism and the myriad of other faiths that have existed throughout human history. By doing so, they strive to show that all religions are the same and therefore equally invalid. They'd argue that Christianity has no more merit than any other religion. Furthermore, many atheists would go further by pointing out that things that previously seemed to mankind to be miraculous (example: the sun rising and setting) are now fully explainable by science. Therefore, they say, we should turn to science instead of faith when seeking to control our fates. This way of thinking is extremely common in our world today, but is it right? I'd argue that it's wrong in every respect.  The God of Christianity is Actus purus and is thus incapable of being controlled or acted upon by outside forces. Often times, superstition seeks to exert control over supernatural forces. This can take on many forms, some of which are more obvious than others. Occult practices and divination are very obvious examples. An athlete believing in a good luck charm or practice is another. Christians should acknowledge that it is impossible for us to change or affect God in any way. Attempts to do so show a lack of respect for the dignity and sovereignty of God.  Futhermore, the Christian God is different than many other gods in that he loves humanity and desires a relationship with each one of us. Rather than seeking control over God, Christians should strive to seek friendship with Him. Through prayer, we can then ask God to use His power in ways that will benefit us. The choice to do so, however, still lies with God. We can rest assured, however, that our God has compassion for each one of us and will always meet our needs, even if his care may manifest itself in unexpected ways. Central to this are the words of Christ, who though God himself, does not seek to control the Father:   \"...not my will but yours be done\" Luke 22:42    Modern atheists often make the mistake of putting too much trust in scientific discoveries and technology, and Christians can easily fall into this trap as well. When we do so, we're engaging in a form of idolatry. Christians have been given dominion over the Earth:  \"God blessed them and God said to them: Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and all the living things that crawl on the earth.\" Genesis 1:28   It's therefore not wrong for us to seek control over nature. However, we must always do in a way that respects the sovereignty of God.     In your own words, explain how our attitude towards God differs from pagan attitudes towards their gods.    Answers may vary but should include discussion of the sovreignty (and thus uncontrollability) of the Christian God. It should also discuss that our God is a loving God who desires relationship with us and who has compassionate care for us.      Are there forms of superstition in your life? To what extent do you think that you're actually trying to control God vs. just doing something fun.    Answers may vary      If a person engages in a superstitious practice like not washing a shirt during a sports season, but doesn't actually believe that it's bringing them good luck, is there still harm being committed? Think about the possibility of scandal     This can still be a form of scandal. Others might be influenced to take up similar practices that they might actually believe in. It can also create an appearance that engaging in superstition is okay or even beneficial for Catholics.      All of creation is a gift from God. All that we do is ultimately only possible because God permits it. When we exert control over nature (whether through science\/technology or other means), it's important to do so with a spirit of humility and gratitude. Why?    Humility reminds us that God and His creation are bigger than our understanding. Even our best and most altruistic efforts to exert dominion over nature are likely to have unexpected consequences. By surrendering our efforts to God and uniting our goals to prayer, we invite God to purify our actions. We should also have a spirit of gratitude to remind ourselves that none of the good that we do is possible apart from God. Thus we help God to retain his supremacy in our hearts and minds.     "

  "title": "The greatest commandment",
  "body": " The greatest commandment   Summary:     Love God and love your neighbor as yourself    In order to holistically love our neighbor, we must care for their natural and supernatural needs     The Greatest Commandment:   In scripture, Jesus gives us the Greatest Commandment:    “[Jesus] said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.  This is the greatest and the first commandment.  The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”  Matthew 22:37-39    Each of us lives and acts in the natural world. God gives us his commandments to help us live according to His will. The greatest commandment unites the supernatural and natural world into one rule for us. We should love God, and when we love one another, we are loving God by loving them. Humans are body (natural) and soul (supernatural). If we are to love our neighbor in a holistic way, we must show concern for their natural and supernatural needs. This is reflected in in the following passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:    “All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and love.  Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.” Catechism of the Catholic Church 1878    How do we care for the material needs of others? In many cases this is obvious. All people need food, water, and shelter. Providing access to quality healthcare is another way in which we love our neighbor through natural means. As Catholics, we should strive to ensure that our care for neighbor is not solely a material benefit, but a spiritual one as well. By incorporating empathy, compassion, friendship, and brotherly\/sisterly love into our material service to one another, we ensure that we are holistically loving our neighbor and serving their needs in the best possible way. The Catholic Church clearly shows us ways that we can care for the body and soul of our neighbor through the lists of corporal (bodily) and spiritual works of mercy.        Corporal works of mercy  Spiritual works of mercy    Feed the hungry  Counsel the doubtful    Give drink to the thirsty  Instruct the ignorant    Clothe the naked  Admonish sinners    Shelter the homeless  Comfort the afflicted    Visit the sick  Forgive offenses    Visit the imprisoned  Bear wrongs patiently    Bury the dead  Pray for the living and the dead     There are other less obvious ways in which we are also called to love our neighbor. Human beings are part of creation and exist within the environment around them. We must therefore show love to neighbor by ALSO showing respect for Creation. This is emphasized in the following quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as well as a couple of Papal encyclicals:    “The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.  Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.”  Catechism of the Catholic Church 2415      “The environment is God's gift to everyone, and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole… In nature, the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God's creative activity, which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs, material or otherwise, while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation.” Caritas in Veritate 48.      “The created things of this world are not free of ownership: ‘For they are yours, O Lord, who love the living’ (Wis 11:26). This is the basis of our conviction that, as part of the universe, called into being by one Father, all of us are linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect.” Laudato si 89.      “Moreover, when our hearts are authentically open to universal communion, this sense of fraternity excludes nothing and no one. It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty towards any creature is ‘contrary to human dignity’. We can hardly consider ourselves to be fully loving if we disregard any aspect of reality: ‘Peace, justice and the preservation of creation are three absolutely interconnected themes, which cannot be separated and treated individually without once again falling into reductionism’” Laudato si 92       The Greatest Commandment sounds like two commandments. Explain why this is not the case.      When we love one another, we love Godâ€™s creation and our neighbors. We cannot fully love God, without loving everything that comes from Him, including creation and our neighbors.        Explain what I mean when I say that we are called to holistically love our neighbor.      We are each body and spirit. In order to love our neighbor, we must show compassionate care for both their body and spirit.        Imagine that you receive healthcare in a clinic that is exceptional in healing you but is simultaneously cold and impersonal. How would you feel? Come up with concrete ideas for how you could prevent a patient from feeling this way if you were a medical professional.      I probably wouldnâ€™t be very happy. I might feel disrespected or as-if I was just a source of income for the hospital\/doctor. If a doctor takes the time to have a real conversation with a patient rather than rushing through a visit, this can help to fulfill the spiritual needs to companionship that the patient has.        Explain a concrete way in which our respect for the environment can manifest itself as love of neighbor. Similarly, explain a concrete way in which abuse of the environment can manifest itself in harming our neighbor.      Picking up garbage along a hiking trail can help the next visitor more fully enjoy the beauty of Godâ€™s creation. Throwing away toxic chemicals can lead to them entering bodies of water that people swim in or get their drinking water from. This can lead to health problems for your neighbor.       "

  "title": "What is science?",
  "body": " What is science?   Summary:     Science is a methodology for investigating the natural world    Laws vs. hypotheses vs. theories    Scientific method    Observations lead to hypotheses which leads to experiments which leads to more observations      Science is something that everyone does, even if they don’t realize it     What is science?    Science is a methodology that allows us to learn about nature. People have been doing science since the beginning of mankind. The development of tools, hunting methods, agriculture, etc. were all dependent on knowledge gained through science. The methodology used for science wasn’t rigorously defined until 1620 when Francis Bacon published his work Novum Organum. Further refinements and definitions have led to what we now call the scientific method . This process begins with making observations about the natural world. These observations can lead to laws or hypotheses. Laws are statements about patterns invariably observed in nature (you can basically think of them as an observation with elite status). They are rules that seek to explain what will happen in a given circumstance based on what has been observed again and again, without exception. A common example of a law is the law of gravity. It can be described in different ways: “what goes up must come down”, “objects with mass attract one another”, or even with a mathematical equation ( ). Note that these descriptions predict what will happen and may even provide a quantitative prediction, but they do NOT explain why. Laws do NOT have to be formalized in textbooks, though. For instance, I’d like to point out that most of us are familiar with the “law of glowing red metal” that states that glowing red metal is quite hot and probably shouldn’t be touched.  The scientific method starts with an observation or law, but progresses further by seeking to explain why nature behaves in the way it does. A statement that seeks to explain the causes of natural phenomena that is based on observations or laws is called a hypothesis . A hypothesis is an explanation that has not been suitably tested. In order to lend support to a hypothesis, scientists often carry out experiments. A properly designed experiment tests the effect of a limited number of variables (ie. something that is changed, and therefore tested in an experiment) while striving to keep everything else as identical as possible. In a properly designed experiment, there are always a minimum of two possible groups: controls and experimental groups. The control group serves as a comparison, showing what the outcome is if the variable is ignored\/absent\/unchanged. The experimental group consists of groups where the variable is changed. By comparing the results between the controls and experimental groups, we can reach conclusions about whether the experiment supports or refutes our hypothesis. Importantly, experiments can NEVER prove a hypothesis to be correct, instead they allow us to reject alternative explanations.  When interpreting the results of experiments and trying to develop explanations for the causes of an observation, one of the principles that guides all of science is known as Ockham’s razor, which states that the simplest explanation that is consistent with known experimental results is the one that should be held. William of Ockham, the namesake of Ockham’s razor, was a Catholic Franciscan friar in the 14 th century, and made several contributions to philosophy and theology. This further highlights the relationship between science, philosophy, and theology; the very roots of scientific thought and logic are grounded in philosophical and theological principles.  Using Ockham’s razor, scientists can begin to piece together models that explain their observations. These models can lead to further hypotheses and experiments. If a hypothesis has withstood numerous experiments, it can be considered to be a theory . A theory is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested (a single experiment or test is rarely enough) and has NEVER been shown to be inconsistent with an experimental result. Experimental results that conflict with a hypothesis do NOT have to lead to outright rejection of the hypothesis and often instead lead to revision or addition of clarifications or exceptions. The distinction between a hypothesis and a theory is subjective and open to interpretation, but scientists all agree that enough experiments should have been carried out to allow obvious alternate explanations to be rejected.  An example of the scientific method in action:  A carpenter observes that wood is a strong building material that is capable of holding a large amount of weight and wants to understand why. The carpenter hypothesizes that thick wood is capable of holding more weight than thin wood. To test this, the carpenter sets up a control group consisting of wood with a standard thickness and experimental groups that have wood with other thicknesses (either thicker or thinner). He then tests each group by observing how many books each piece of wood can hold before breaking. His results show that thin boards hold less weight than thick boards. We’d say that board thickness correlates with board strength. While this result supports his hypothesis, there are still other possible explanations for the result. For instance, perhaps the process used for reducing the thickness of the boards damaged the wood by introducing cracks. Alternatively, the thin pieces of wood might have had more (or fewer) wood grains and that might instead have been the source of the observed outcomes. . Correlation does not equal causation!     Come up with 3 additional laws of nature that you have encountered in your own life that you wonâ€™t find listed in a science textbook.      The law of melting butter. When you heat butter, it turns into a liquid. The law of successful campfires. Camp fires burn best when they have adequate ventilation near the bottom. The law of autumn. Leaves turn from green to yellow, orange, or red in the fall.        Come up with 3 ways in which you used the scientific method in your own life without realizing what you were doing.      I try out different amounts of time when frying eggs to see whether the yolk is hard or runny. (experiment). I observe that when I hit the up volume button on the remote control, the TV gets louder (observation). I think that my lawn is turning brown because it needs more water (hypothesis)        Look around you right now. Observe something and write it down. Try to develop a hypothesis that explains that observation. Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. Why controls would you need? What results would you expect that would validate your hypothesis?      Light is coming through various sized slits in the blinds in my room. I think that light can always pass through any gap, no matter how small. I get two objects that can move to change the gap size between them. I place a light behind them and observe if the light can pass through at various gap sizes. A negative control would be if the objects were pressed together so no gap exists. A positive control would be the light itself without the objects to create the gap (to just make sure that I can see the light and that itâ€™s working.        Why is it important to develop alternative explanations to experimental observations?      These can remind us that scientific theories are never certain. Also, they can help us design new experiments to add greater certainty to theories (or possibly to prove them wrong).        It is seen that lead exposure levels correlate with crime rates. Does this mean that lead exposure causes crime? If not, what come up with some alternative explanations.      Not necessarily. Perhaps people who are exposed to higher levels of lead tend to be more impoverished. Perhaps that poverty is the root cause of the high crime rate.       "

  "body": " Faith, Science, Engineering, and Politics   Summary:     The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics    Science is an essential part of what makes us human    Science and faith are complementary and not at odds with one another    Faith should lead us to use science in good and just ways    What is meant by the deification of science    What are some ways in which science has built mistrust      Science, engineering, and politics are interdependent     The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics   The modern world is obsessed with science. It is easy to think of science as a modern marvel, and indeed some people have begun to deify it. The discoveries of scientists have in many cases dramatically improved life for people around the world and promise to work wonders such as the eradication of disease (even if some of these promises seem far off). Many of the observations of nature that in history appeared miraculous now have scientific explanations and theories. For instance, the variety of life of Earth is now widely believed (even amongst Catholic scientists) to have resulted from evolution rather than a single creation event (it’s worth noting, less you think of this as a source of conflict between faith and science that Catholic scientists still believe in a Creation event, but that the events that followed and their timing differ from a literal reading of Genesis). Because of this, many people have come to reject religion as superstitious nonsense, since science appears (to some) as if it might be able to explain all natural phenomena. Many modern atheists use statements like this to argue that if God is not necessary to explain anything in nature, then it doesn’t make sense to believe in the existence of God. They of course forget that science is a tool for investigating only what can be observed in nature , and therefore it’s incapable of investigating the existence God. Furthermore, as we learned about in the previous lesson, supernatural causes are a logical necessity for the existence of nature. Additionally, the scientific method depends on change for experiments to work (recall that changes are actualization of some potency). All changes must ultimately have their root in Actus Purus…something that modern atheists conveniently ignore.  On the other extreme, many people are prone to reject scientific progress for a variety of reasons. Indeed, scientific investigations and technological “advances” have created numerous problems for society, and it is understandable why people have developed a distrust of science as a result. In the 1920s, a scientist named Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered that the addition of a chemical compound containing lead into gasoline could help it burn in a more reliable way in car engines. Leaded gasoline was thus introduced and was used in the United States until 1996. Over that time, vast quantities of lead were released into the environment and resulted in a variety of toxic effect. In a different example, in the Tuskegee syphilis study, several hundred black men with syphilis in the United States had treatment unknowingly withheld from them so that scientists could study the long-term effects of the disease. Once the details of this horrendous study came to light, it understandably had a negative impact on the trust of black Americans for the American medical community   The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Volume 133, Issue 1, February 2018, Pages 407–455 .  Nowadays, there are many prominent examples of mistrust between the scientific community and various groups of people. Global warming and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are two prominent areas. In this text, I’ll neither argue for or against those issues, but instead focus on the root cause of the distrust. Some of the distrust stems from the fact that different scientific studies can sometimes arrive at different conclusions. The reasons for this are complex and varied, but so are the subjects being studied.  For instance, one study might show that chemical X causes cancer while another study doesn’t. This disagreement might be due to differences in the amounts of chemical X used in the study, the amount of time of the exposure, the use of mice vs. rabbits, the type of test used, etc. Cancer is a very complex disease, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the studies and factors that influence its occurrence are complex as well.  Similarly, in the field of climatology (the study of climate) there are studies and data that show evidence of man’s role in global warming and other data that disputes this. Can science come to meaningful conclusions then? In cases where different studies have different outcomes and conclusions, the scientific community tries to carry out more and better designed studies in an effort to arrive at a consensus , but a consensus represents the belief that the majority of the best studies support a particular theory.  The bias of researchers can also play a role in science. An ethical scientist tries to avoid bias, but it can be difficult to eliminate entirely, especially since the importance of a scientific discovery is often linked to funding. In some cases, bias can and has led to incorrect interpretations of data, outright falsification of data, and entirely incorrect conclusions. However, bias is present in pretty much every part of life, with examples ranging from restaurant preferences to political decision making. Bias shouldn’t be a reason to distrust all scientists and scientific theories, but it is important to scrutinize scientific conclusions, especially when they begin to impact our lives, the lives of others, and\/or our environment.  Another reason for distrust of science has to deal with a misunderstanding of what science is. I would argue that much of the disagreement and distrust of science in our society is not at science at all, but rather at engineering and even more so politics . Engineering and science are closely related and interdependent fields. Where science seeks answers to the causes of things, engineering seeks to use that knowledge to create solutions to problems. Politics is related to both fields since our political leaders strive (or should strive) to find the best ways to use scientific knowledge and engineering creations to further the good of society.  As an example, let’s take the example of the Covid vaccines. A combination of scientific discoveries and engineering advancements lead to the development of the first Covid vaccines. Their purpose was to combat the Covid-19 virus, which was rapidly spreading across the globe. The disease was poorly understood and was able to cause death, hence the desire for rapid vaccine development (a political decision). The development of the vaccine was extremely rapid, thanks to many advances in biochemical engineering and science. Political pressure led to the implementation of the vaccine before thorough testing by scientists and engineers had been accomplished. Vaccine mandates followed, and whether justified or not, they were undoubtedly controversial. Again, though, vaccine mandates are not science, they are political actions. Many people have argued that the vaccines were untested, ineffective, and potentially harmful and that science failed in these regards. I would argue that scientists and engineers did not fail at all, but actually performed extraordinarily well. The scientific method takes considerable time and in the case of the Covid vaccine, due to political decisions, much of the discoveries of scientists lagged behind the roll out of the vaccines and their mandatory implementation. Indeed, scientists can’t test the effectiveness and safety of something that hasn’t been created yet. The decision to roll out the vaccines before the typical years worth of testing were complete wasn’t a decision of scientists but one of politicians. Many scientists definitely contributed to those political decisions, but it’s important to realize that they weren’t acting as scientists but as activists in those instances. Activists can act in ethical or unethical ways, and the same goes for scientists (and I’ll leave it to the reader to form their own opinions in this case). I’d even argue that activism is a necessity among scientists; if scientists can’t advocate for the importance of their research, then it won’t get the funding or support that is needed to carry it out (in many ways this is like a small business owner advertising a new product…but I digress…). Now, years after the vaccine rollout, biologists have largely reached a consensus about the effectiveness and safety of the Covid-19 vaccines. The majority of scientific research supports the conclusion that the initial vaccines weren’t very effective at preventing the spread of the disease, though they were effective in lessening its severity. Additionally, statistical analysis revealed that there are a variety of safety issues that correlated with the initial vaccines, though their rate of occurrence was quite low. The scientific method didn’t fail us, but it took time to carry out the studies and arrive at conclusions. Unfortunately, and perhaps unavoidably, the lines between science, engineering, and politics are often blurred and this can regrettably result in distrust in science and scientists for reasons that aren’t science at all.  When science and technology are deified, great error can result. On the other hand, lack of trust in scientists and their conclusions can lead to distrust and animosity and can potentially lead to the rejection of engineering advances that can help mankind. What then is the proper attitude to take towards science and its relationship to faith and human flouring? Read the following text from the Church’s Pastoral Constitution, Gaudium et Spes :  “Christians, on pilgrimage toward the heavenly city, should seek and think of these things which are above. This duty in no way decreases, rather it increases, the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the building of a more human world. Indeed, the mystery of the Christian faith furnishes them with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this duty more courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity, one which gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man.  When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of technology, in order that it might bear fruit and become a dwelling worthy of the whole human family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social groups, he carries out the design of God manifested at the beginning of time, that he should subdue the earth, perfect creation and develop himself. At the same time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself at the service of his brethren.  Furthermore, when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy, history and of mathematical and natural science, and when he cultivates the arts, he can do very much to elevate the human family to a more sublime understanding of truth, goodness, and beauty, and to the formation of considered opinions which have universal value. Thus mankind may be more clearly enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which was with God from all eternity, composing all things with him, rejoicing in the earth, delighting in the sons of men.  In this way, the human spirit, being less subjected to material things, can be more easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator. Moreover, by the impulse of grace, he is disposed to acknowledge the Word of God, Who before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was already \"in the world\" as \"the true light which enlightens every man\" (John 1:9-10).  Indeed today's progress in science and technology can foster a certain exclusive emphasis on observable data, and an agnosticism about everything else. For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth. By virtue of their methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things. Indeed the danger is present that man, confiding too much in the discoveries of today, may think that he is sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher things.  Those unfortunate results, however, do not necessarily follow from the culture of today, nor should they lead us into the temptation of not acknowledging its positive values. Among these values are included: scientific study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries, the necessity of working together with others in technical groups, a sense of international solidarity, a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even to protect men, the desire to make the conditions of life more favorable for all, especially for those who are poor in culture or who are deprived of the opportunity to exercise responsibility. All of these provide some preparation for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which can be animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world.”  Pure science is a tool that humanity can use to gain knowledge of God’s creation. Knowledge of creation sheds light on its Creator and is therefore a commendable exercise for a Christian to undertake. Unfortunately, human history is filled with examples of the knowledge of science being misused for sinful purposes. The use of knowledge is distinct from the knowledge itself, often involving other human enterprises such as medicine, business, politics, etc. Science itself is not free from sin either. When scientists place the pursuit of knowledge above the laws of God, unethical experimentation can result.     I'd argue that science is an essential part of what makes us human. Do you agree or disagree? Why?      Humans are created to know and wonder. Science is the way in which we can do this in the natural world        The text above describes two very different ways in which science is misunderstood in society. Explain these two ways in your own words.      Science can be misunderstood to be the â€œanswer to our prayersâ€. Science can also be distrusted because of how it is utilized for engineering and political purposes. Scientific investigations can also be carried out in unethical ways.        How are engineering, science, and politics related?      Politics tries to encourage human flourishing. It needs solutions to problems, which is the purpose of engineering. Engineering relies on knowledge from science in order to design good solutions to problems.        One of the footnotes above says that scientists can be activists in ethical ways or unethical ways. Do you agree? What requirements would you have for a scientist to behave as an ethical activist?      An ethical activist\/scientist should not state their theories as scientific fact. They should also present the best synopsis of the available knowledge (and alternative explanations).        How can science aid faith? How can faith aid science?      Science can remove superstition from faith and correct errors in our knowledge. Faith can allow science to pursue worthwhile knowledge in ethical ways.        Science can lead to knowledge about the natural world. How is that knowledge connected to our love of God? (Think back to the last lesson)      Knowledge of nature is knowledge of Godâ€™s Creation and thus provides insight into God Himself. It can also provide us the knowledge to better care for our neighbors. In the last lesson we learned that love of neighbor is inseparable from love of God.        What are some ethical science problems that you foresee yourself having to contend with in your profession? How might you deal with this?      Answers may vary        Academic pursuits (such as you are now undertaking) are full of ethical struggles as you strive to acquire knowledge and progress toward your vocation. In many ways this is similar to the ethical dilemmas encountered by scientists. Come up with 3 ways in which a student might be tempted to sin as they pursue knowledge and advancement.      Answers may vary        Christ has conquered sin and has redeemed the world. Use this fact to compose a short prayer that you can use is difficult ethical moments throughout your academic and professional career.      Answers may vary       "

  "body": " Chemistry   Summary:     What is the definition of chemistry, matter, and mass?    What is matter and what is energy?     Section 3: Chemistry   Modern science is separated into the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. There is considerable overlap between these subjects since each discipline can influence the others. Chemistry is the study of the properties of matter . Matter can be defined as anything that occupies space and has mass . Basically, everything that you can see and touch is matter. Even particles that are too small to be seen, such as atoms and molecules, are still matter because they occupy space and have mass. Energy (defined in a later chapter), on the other hand, is NOT matter. It is a property that matter can have, but it is not a thing that occupies space. Light and heat are things that we can experience in the physical world, but they lack mass and thus are not matter. Sound is another example of energy. Sound is caused by the vibration of matter, but it refers to the vibration, not to the particles that are vibrating.  Chemistry is often referred to as the central science. This is because to fully understand the behavior and properties of matter, we first have to understand the laws of physics. Physics provides chemistry with information about the composition of matter and its most basic parts. It also provides chemists with an understanding of energy and how it interacts with matter. At the same time, all organisms are comprised of matter; thus, if we want to understand life, we need to understand the matter that comprises it. Chemistry aids biology by helping us understand how organisms function and can also help us learn how to manipulate biology, for instance by designing pharmaceuticals or pesticides.     Write down the definitions of chemistry, matter, and mass.      See the definitions in the text       For questions 2-5, answer the following question: Are the following things best described as matter or energy?      The heat from a fire      Energy        The smoke from a fire      Matter        The vibration of a string on a violin      Energy        A string on a violin      Matter        What are your career goals (discuss this with your group)? How might the knowledge of chemistry help you in your career?      Answers may vary        Even if you never directly use the knowledge from this course in your profession, does this course still have value to you? Is knowledge without purpose worthless?      Answers may vary for the question about the personal value of this course. Knowledge about creation contains knowledge of God. Knowing God is obviously good, so pursuing any knowledge of creation has inherent goodness.       "

In chemistry, they have many uses as we’ll see if upcoming chapters and exercises. The most common math that we do with fractions in chemistry is multiplying and dividing them. To carry out multiplication of fractions, we simply multiply together all of the values in the numerator The numerator is the top of a fraction, keeping the product in the numerator of the final answer, and then do a similar operation with the denominator   Multiplication of fractions example 1:     Multiplication of fractions example 2:     Dividing fractions is similarly quite easy to do. In a division problem, the first number is the dividend and the second is the divisor . Division of fractions can be expressed in multiple ways     Please note that the dividend is the numerator in the fraction expression and the divisor becomes the denominator. To complete this division problem, we simply need to flip the divisor and multiply that value by the dividend.      Section 2: Canceling out factors and labels in calculations   Another VERY important lesson to remember about fractions is that if the numerator and denominator both contain the same factor, then they cancel out. This is true for both numbers in the fractions but also for labels like units. See the examples below:  Example 1: (the 3s cancel out)   Example 2: (the “miles” labels cancel out)      Exercises:    Fraction math. Do the following math problem without using a calculator           Multiply 7 times 4 and put that on top. Then multiply 3 times 3 and put that on the bottom.                 Multiply the numbers in the numerator and put that value into the numerator of the final answer. Multiply the numbers in the denominator and put that value into the denominator of the final answer.  See if you can simplify your answer by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.                 Flip the second fraction, then multiply the two fractions.                              Dividing by 9 is the same as multiplying by             Simplify the following expression without using a calculator.          Look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and cancel them out before multiplying the fractions.                 Flip the 2nd fraction. Then look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and cancel them out. Finally, multiply the fractions.                              Treat the units like numbers. If the same unit occurs in the numerator and denominator, cancel them out.           "

  "body": " Scientific notation   Summary:     Scientific notation    Know how to convert between standard and scientific notation    Remember that a positive power is associated with a large number (greater than 10) and a negative power is associated with a small number (less than 1)      Correct use of a calculator    Use the correct scientific notation button on your calculator to avoid errors    Know when to use parentheses       Scientific notation   In chemistry, we frequently have to make use of very large numbers (e.g. when we’re discussing numbers of atoms) as well as very small numbers (e.g. the weight of an atom). We have a couple of strategies that make this much more palatable for us. One such strategy is to have different units of measurement for discussing large numbers vs. small numbers. The other common approach is to use scientific notation. Ultimately scientific notation is required, even if we use different units, because we still need to use very large (or small) numbers to express the relationship between these different units. For example, if we are talking about the distance across an atom, a common unit of measurement is an Angstrom. A hydrogen atom has a diameter of approximately 1.1 Angstroms. But how many inches is that? In order to convert between units of Angstroms and inches we'd have to know that 1 Angstrom = 0.00000000394 inches. Working with that number is obviously obnoxious, requiring us to count exactly how many zeroes there are. To get around this, we like to use scientific notation.   a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base   To write a number in scientific notation, we combine a coefficient with a base . The coefficient is always a number that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and is written as a decimal. The coefficient is then multiplied by the base which is 10 raised to some power.    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    A positive power makes the coefficient larger by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the right by the number of digit places given by the number in the power. Conversely, a negative power makes the coefficient smaller by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the left by the number of digit places given by the number in the power.  We also have to be able to take a number that is written in standard notation and rewrite it in scientific notation. To do this, we move the decimal point in the direction that will result in a coefficient that has a value between 1 and 10. We count the number of digit places that we moved the decimal and that becomes the value in the power. If we moved the decimal to the left, then the power remains positive. If the decimal had to be moved to the right, then the value in the power becomes negative.     a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    One of the things that often confuses students about scientific notation is remembering when to move the decimal to the right or the left. These rules can be summed up by remembering the simple rule that big numbers have positive powers and small numbers have negative powers. Remembering this rule can help you determine for yourself whether you should move the decimal right or left.   Scientific notation and calculators   Doing multi-step calculations often leads to errors. These errors often result from incorrect calculator usage. It is important to make sure that you are correctly inputting scientific notation into your calculator. Often the correct way to do this is using the EE button on your calculator. If, on the other hand, you input scientific notation using the times button and then your exponent button (which is typically either a \"^\" or a button), you may inadvertently input the incorrect math problem. See the example below:     Correct input: 4.1 EE 3 “divided by” 3.3 EE 10 =   Incorrect input: 4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 “divided by” 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10  This incorrect input above is actually calculating the following:   Another way that you can correctly input scientific notation is to put parentheses around each of your scientific notation inputs. This allows you to input the scientific notation using whichever method you’d prefer.  ( 4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 ) “divided by” ( 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10)  Another important calculator rule to remember is that when we write complex fractions, all of the operations in the numerator and denominator respectively are carried out before the division step. This is correctly input into a calculator by remembering to put parentheses around both the numerator and denominator. See the example below:     ( 7 “plus” 3 ) “divided by” ( 5.5 EE 3 “plus” 100 ) =      Write the following numbers in scientific notation without using a calculator.     3,001.002             5,000,005             10,055,057,001             0.000 057 8             0.08             0.000 000 007 044              Write the following numbers in standard notation without using a calculator.

  "body": " Algebra review   Summary:     Use opposite operations to isolate your variable of interest    Work through the order of operations backwards     Algebra review   The final part of this math review is a brief review of algebra. We use algebra to rearrange mathematical expressions to solve for some unknown. There are two things to remember when doing algebraic rearrangements. First, our goal is to isolate the variable of interest, remembering that it must be in the numerator if we’re dealing with fractions. Second, the way in which we will isolate the variable is by carrying out opposite operations on both sides of the equation. Some useful reminders:     Addition and subtraction are opposite operations; multiplication and division are opposite operations     Example:  To isolate x we must add three to both sides because addition is the opposite operation for subtraction      Example:  To isolate x we must multiply both sides by 2 because multiplication is the opposite operation for division       If there are multiple quantities that must be moved, work in the direction of the reverse of the order of operations     Example: We have to use two reverse operations (subtraction and division) to isolate x, but which do we do first? If we were computing the left side of the equation, we'd first multiply 3 times x and then add 5. When isolating x, we must go in the reverse order of operations. So in this case we need to undo the addition of 5 before undoing the multiplication by 3. So the first thing we do is subtract 5 from both sides. Then we can divide by 3.      Example: If we were computing the left side of the equation, we'd first add 5 to x and then divide the sum by 2. The reverse order would have us first multiply both sides of the equation by two and then subtract 5 from both sides.       If the unknown is in the denominator of a fraction, you need to move it to the numerator (NOTE: Everything else should first be moved to the other side other than the fraction with your unknown ). You can do this by either multiplying both sides by the unknown or by taking the reciprocal (ie. flipping) of both sides of the equation.     Example (Method 1): solve for x in the following equation Multiply both sides of the equation by x to get it in the numerator. Then move the 4 and the \"a\" to the other side of the equation by dividing and multiplying, respectively.      Example (Method 2): solve for x in the following equation Take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation (ie. flip the fractions on both sides). Then move the 2 to the other side of the equation by multiplying both sides by 2.           For the following problems, solve for the value of c. In some cases your solution will be an expression rather than a number. Write out all of your steps                                                                             "

The numbers that we use in our calculations often describe measurements or numbers of things, such as numbers of molecules. This then raises an important consideration for us, namely how precisely do we know the numbers in our calculations? For instance, if I’m measuring the length of a piece of string, do I know its length precisely to the nearest inch, or to the nearest millimeter, or to the nearest nanometer? The answer to that question depends on the tools that were used to make the measurement and their level of precision. Obviously, you won’t be able to tell how many nanometers long a piece of string is by using a typical ruler; another much more expensive measuring device would likely be required.  To understand how precisely we know a quantity, we will first discuss the difference between exact and measured numbers. Exact numbers are discrete things that can be counted (ex. 3 eggs), quantities that are exact definitions (ex. there are 12 inches in one foot), or desired values (ex. the established dosage for a pharmaceutical is 10 mg\/kg\/day). Measured numbers are any quantity that had to be measured. They are also found when we are equating units that occur in different systems of measurement (ex. 2.54 cm=1 inch; 1 inch is very close to 2.54 cm, but an inch is not defined as being exactly 2.54 cm).  Exact numbers are known to an infinite level of precision. If you have 3 eggs, you don’t have 3.0000001 eggs…you have exactly 3.00000000… (keeps on going…) eggs. If the dosage of drug that you are supposed to give to a patient is 10mg\/kg\/day, the desired dose is not higher or lower than that…it is exactly that value. Measured numbers, on the other hand, are known only to a certain level of precision. A race may have taken exactly 9.813453223 (feel free to add other random digits on the end) seconds, but if I am using a stop watch that only measures hundredths of a second, then my measured value would be 9.81 seconds. Because of this, measured numbers always have a certain amount of uncertainty associated with them. How then do we communicate the level of certainty with which we know a number?  This brings us to the concept of significant figures . Significant figures are those digits in a number that reveal the level of precision. We have to worry about the number of significant figures when we’re dealing with measured numbers, since those values are only known to a certain degree of precision. If a stopwatch at the end of a race reads 9.81 seconds, then that measurement has 3 significant figures (the 9, 8, and 1 are each significant). In that case, the time was measured to the hundredths place, but not to the thousandths place and the reported value should reflect that. Exact numbers, on the other hand, have an infinite number of significant figures because of their infinite precision.  In a measured numbers, there are some simple rules to remember in order to identify which digits are significant. First of all, non-zero digits are always significant when the number is written in standard notation (more on scientific notation in just a little bit). The complication comes from zeros in measured numbers.   Rules for significant digits    All non-zero digits are significant.    Zeroes are sometimes significant    When zeros are to the far left of the number, they are never significant    Zeros in between non-zero digits are always significant    Zeros to the far right of a number are significant ONLY if there is a decimal point written in the number.        Some examples of this:     0.0034 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 1)    3001 (the zeros are significant because of rule 2)    400.0 (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)    300 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)    300. (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3; notice the decimal has been purposely included)    The last rule for significant figures has to deal with scientific notation. In scientific notation, the power and the base are NOT significant. The only significant figures come from the coefficient portion, and it obeys the rules covered previously, including the rules about zeros. So has 5 significant figures (4.0010; the 10 to the 10 th power is not significant). Sometimes we HAVE to write a number in scientific notation to convey the correct number of significant figures. For instance, if you measured as distance of 300 cm to 2 significant figures, you can’t indicate that by writing 300 cm (1 significant figure) or 300. cm (2 significant figures). You can show it by writing cm.

  "body": " Analog vs. digital measurements   Summary:     Digital vs. analog measurements    Digital    All digits shown on the display should be written down    Do NOT add any extra digits      Analog    Read all digits provided by the scale shown    Estimate one extra digit ONLY if all of the digits of the previous position are marked on the scale         Digital vs. Analog Measurements   When we make measurements with analog devices like a ruler or a graduated cylinder, the process for determining the number of significant figures in your measurement is more complicated than with a digital device. With a digital device, you simply record all of the displayed numbers in your measured number and obey the rules that were learned previously for significant figures in order to determine which digits are significant . For example if a balance reads 0.320 grams, then your measurement is 0.320 grams with 3 significant figures (the left zero is NOT significant because of the rules you learned in the last section).  When we use an analog device, we frequently see that the line that we’re measuring occurs between values on the measuring scale. When reporting these measurements, we report all of the digits that are provided by the measuring scale PLUS we estimate the value of one extra digit by mentally subdividing the scale into 10 equal portions. See the example below:    An arrow being measured with an analog scale. The arrow falls between 0.9 and 1.0 units on the scale.   A graph with an arrow being measured with an analog scale   If we’re trying to measure the length of the orange arrow as shown in the scale provided depicts tenths of a unit (let’s say it’s centimeters). The orange arrow appears to be between 0.9 and 1 cm long. Since this is an analog scale, we should ALWAYS estimate one extra significant digit, even if that digit is a 0. In this case, my estimate would be 0.94 cm, but yours might differ slightly (though it should be 0.9 something).    An arrow is being measured with an analog scale. Not all of the tenths are shown on the scale. The arrow falls between the 0.5 and 1.0 markings.   Measuring an arrow with an analog scale with incomplete markings.   In the case shown in not all of the digits in the tenths place are shown, only 0.5. Because of this we don’t estimate an extra decimal place. Instead we estimate for the decimal place shown by the most precise markings, in this case the tenths place. My estimate would be 0.9 cm. Your estimate might be 0.8 cm or even 1.0 cm.     Record the proper measurement with the following devices (don’t worry about the units). How many significant figures are in each measurement?     An arrow being measured with an analog scale. All of the ones digits are shown. The arrow just touches the 5 marking.    5.0 (or possibly 4.9 or 5.1--the measurement MUST have 2 significant figures)      An arrow being measured with an analog scale. The scale shows incomplete tenths markings. The arrow is between the 0.0 and 0.2 markings.    0.1 or 0.2 (The measurement should have 1 significant figure)      An arrow being measured with an analog scale. The scale shows incomplete tens markings. The arrow is between the 40 and 60 markings.    50 (40,50, or 60 could be acceptable)      "

  "body": " Significant figures in calculations    Significant figures in calculations    Multiplication\/division    Count the significant figures in each starting number    Round your answer to have the same number of significant figures as the starting number with the fewest      Addition\/subtraction    Determine the most precise digit place in the starting numbers    Round your answer to the digit place that is the least precise out of those you’ve chosen in the first step      Multiple operations    Mark the digit place that you should be rounding to after each step but do NOT round    Keep at least one extra digit beyond the rounding spot    Treat this number as having the number of significant digits that are indicated by your marked digit place, even though it has extra digits      After the final calculation determine where the number should be rounded to using the multiplication\/division or addition\/subtraction rules    Round the final answer appropriately           Significant figures in calculations   What do we do if we have to do calculations that involve measured numbers? For instance, what if three different students measure the orange arrow above and we are asked to compute the average of those measurements? For instance, if the three students measured the line to be 0.92 cm, 0.94 cm, and 0.95 cm, then the average from your calculator would be 0.9366666666…cm. Do we know the average that precisely? In order to do figure out the number of significant figures in this case, we have to learn rules for significant figures in calculations as well as how to round.  We’ll start with rounding. If your calculator were to display the answer to a calculation as 9.874030234 and you have to round it to 3 significant figures, your first step is to identify the first 3 significant figures in the number, starting from the left (in this case 9.87). You then look at the next digit to the right (in this case a 4). If that digit is 0-4, you don’t round up the figures that you are keeping. If it is 5-9, then you round up the rightmost kept significant figure. In this case, since the digit is a 4, we would not round up the 7 in 9.87…so the final rounded number should be 9.87. In contrast, if we were trying to round 9.9987 to 4 significant figures, then we’d keep the 9.998, look at the next digit (which is a 7). This would cause us to round up the 8, which would result in an answer of 9.999.  The rules for calculations are divided into 3 parts: rules for addition\/subtraction, rules for multiplication, and rules for logarithms and exponents. In this chapter, we’ll cover the first two sets of rules only. The rule for logarithms and exponents will be covered in a later chapter.  The multiplication\/division rule is the most common that we use in this class. The rule states that the answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value that had the fewest. Thus, if we multiply the measured numbers of 4.5, 0.3, and 9.888, we get a calculator answer of 13.3488. This should be rounded to 1 significant figure because our starting values had 2, 1, and 4 significant figures respectively and the rule states that our answer should have the same number of significant figures as our starting value that had the least (in this case 1). So our final reported value should be 10.  When adding and subtracting, the number of significant figures does not matter. What matters is the digit place of the most precise significant figure in each number. What do I mean by the most precise significant figure…consider the measured number 4.432 ft. In this case the 2 is the most precise significant figure because it represents the smallest level of detail. When adding or subtracting the rule states that the final answer’s most precise significant figure should be in the same digit place as the starting value with the least most precise significant figure (that’s a mouthful…but it’s easy to demonstrate).  If you were adding the following measured numbers: 0.34, 0.0002, and 15.3 our calculator would display 15.6402. The question is then how should we round this number? The most precise significant figures in each of our starting numbers are 4, 2, and 3 respectively (each is highlighted in yellow). The 4 is in the hundredths place, the 2 in the ten thousandths, and the 3 in the tenths. Out of those options, the tenths place is the least significant place and so our final number will be rounded to the tenths place, giving us 15.6. This is easily demonstrated by lining the values up vertically and rounding the final answer to the most significant digit place that is furthest to the left.     What if a calculation requires both addition and multiplication? In that case, the best practice is to save the rounding for the very end. Do NOT round along the way or you may introduce errors. What you need to do is think about what the rounding would look like after each step in order and then round the final answer based on that. For instance, if you were averaging the measurements 9.87, 9.99, and 9.64 grams, you would need to add them and then divide by 3. If you add them you get 29.5 on most calculators, but you should be thinking about what place that should be rounded to…in this case the hundredths place. That number 29.5 (or 29.50) would then be divided by 3. In this case, 3 is an exact number with an infinite number of significant figures because you are averaging exactly 3 numbers. You calculator might display 9.83333333. The question is how many significant figures should we keep? The addition step should have given us 4 significant figures. The division step involved a number with 4 significant figures and another with an infinite number. Thus our final answer should have 4 significant figures (9.833 grams).  A helpful way for keeping track of this is to circle the digit place that should be rounded to after each step in the calculation (even though we won’t round until the end. This can help you keep track of how many significant figures each number has (or which digit place the most precise digit is in) for each number along the way. See the example below:   Compute the following and round to the correct number of significant figures. Assume each number shown in the original calculation is a measured number.          Rewrite (round if necessary) the following numbers to have the indicated number of significant figures.     9.9800 (4 significant figures)      9.980        9.9800 (3 significant figures)      9.98        9.9800 (7 significant figures)      9.980000        9.9800 (2 significant figures)      10.

  "body": " What are acids and bases?   Summary:     Acids donate ions to other things and increase the amount of in a solution    Bases accept ions and increase the amount of in a solution     What are acids and bases?   There are multiple definitions of acids and bases which all generally say the same things, but with different ways of looking at it. These definitions are summarized in the table below:         Name  Definition of an acid  Definition of a base    Arrhenius definition  Produces H +  Produces OH -    Brønstead-Lowry definition  Donates H +  Accepts H +     Compounds like HCl are acids because they are ionic compounds and when we place them into water, the ions will dissociate producing H + and Cl - . Because HCl produces H + in water, it fits the definition of an Arrhenius acid. However, H + doesn’t exist for very long in water. It rapidly reacts with water to produce hydronium ion , H 3 O + . Thus the HCl actually donated an H + to water in this reaction, fitting the Brønstead-Lowry definition of an acid             A lone pair of electrons on water forms a covalent bond with a ion to form a hydronium ion.   Sodium hydroxide fits the definition of a base. When it is dissolved in water, it quickly dissociates into ions, Na + and OH - . As a result, it fits the definition of an Arrhenius base since the concentration of hydroxide increases. It also fits the definition of a Brønstead-Lowry base, but this takes a bit more effort to see. This is because the hydroxide that is produced can accept a H + forming water.           Acids and bases don’t just react with water, they can be mixed allowing them to react with one another. In these cases, often the Brønstead-Lowry definition is easier to use to identify an acid from a base. Consider the reaction shown below:     In this reaction, the NH 3 (ammonia) accepts an H + from CH 3 CO 2 H (acetic acid). Thus ammonia is acting as a base and acetic acid is an acid because it donates an H + .  What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH 4 not an acid while HCl is? Hold that question for now. It will be discussed more in the conjugate acids and bases section later in this lesson.  "

  "title": "Naming acids and bases",
  "body": " Naming acids and bases   Summary:     Acid naming rules    Bases naming rules     Naming acids and bases   We already know how to name the common bases that we’ll see in this chapter. Most of the bases we’ll be discussing are ionic compounds that contain the hydroxide ion. We’ll be naming those compounds in the same way that we’ve named them in the past. There is one additional base that we’ll frequently encounter in this chapter, NH 3 , which is called ammonia (you should learn this). We’ll learn about other nitrogen containing bases in later chapters as well as how to name them.  Naming acids follows different rules than we’ve used previously. When naming acids, it depends on if the acid is 1) composed of two elements, 2) contains a polyatomic ion, or 3) is an organic acid (more on these in a later chapter). Acids that contain only two elements include HCl, HBr, and HI. For these acids, we name them by starting with the name of the anion (ex. HCl—we start with chloride). We then drop the -ide ending and replace it with “-ic acid”. Lastly we add “hydro-“ as a prefix. So, HCl is hydrochloric acid.  If the acid contains a polyatomic ion, then we name the anion and drop the -ate ending from the name (we won’t worry about polyatomic ions with other endings). We then add on “ic-acid” and in some cases instead add “-uric acid” or “-oric acid” (if the name of the polyatomic ion ends in an “f” sound; ex. -fate or -phate).  Additionally, some acids are polyprotic acids, meaning that they have more than one H+ that can be donated to a base. Phosphoric acid, for example, is the acid produced from the phosphate ion, . The acid thus must have 3 H + added to fully neutralize the 3 - charge, giving the formula H 3 PO 4 . Previously, we learned that there are other forms of the phosphate anion that has one or two H + s added on. and are called hydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate respectively. These are also acids since they have one or more H + s to donate, but since they are also polyatomic ions, their name is simply the name of the polyatomic ion.  To figure out the formula for an acid, we need to know the anion that it is paired with, both its formula and its charge. We then only need to pair it with the appropriate number of H + ions in order to have the number of positive and negative charges be equal.  "

Strengths of acids and bases   When an acid or base is dissolved into water, the compound dissociates into ions (or produces ions in other cases). This process can be written as a chemical reaction. See the example below:     In a previous chapter, we learned that all chemical reactions are reversible and we learned about equilibrium. The same is true for the dissociation of an acid or base in water. Some of these dissociation reactions have equilibriums that lie so far towards the products that they are nearly irreversible reactions. When these acids\/bases dissolve into water, they very nearly completely dissociate into their ions. These compounds are said to be strong acids and strong bases. There is a list of strong acids and strong bases that you need to memorize:  Strong acids: .  Strong bases: group I and II metals paired with hydroxide in an ionic compound (ex. NaOH)   Weak acids and weak bases are ones where the compound dissociates into ions when put into water, but not completely. There is still a measurable amount of the starting compound left over. This is because the reverse reaction still occurs to an appreciable extent. These weak acids and bases partially dissociate into ions when dissolved. Thankfully there is no list of weak acids\/bases that you need to memorize. All you need to know is that if you’re dealing with an acid or base that isn’t a strong acid or base, that it will be a weak one instead.  "

  "body": " Conjugate acid \/ base pairs   Summary:     Acids become conjugate bases after they lose a hydrogen ion    Bases become conjugate acids after gaining a hydrogen ion    Conjugate acid \/ base pairs are compounds (or ions) that are related by the addition\/removal of a single ion.     Conjugate acid \/ base pairs   The dissociation of an acid or base is a reversible reaction (excepting strong acids and bases). If acetic acid functions as an acid, donating its H + to something else, then acetate results as a product. In the reverse reaction, that acetate ion would accept an H + once again becoming acetic acid. Thus acetate would be functioning as a base. Every acid produces a base after donating its H + . Likewise, every base produces an acid after accepting an H + , because the reverse reaction would have the product donating the H + that the base form had just received.  Every acid will therefore form a base in a chemical reaction. This is called the conjugate base of that acid. Together they form a conjugate acid-base pair , two molecules whose only difference is the presence or absence of an H + . Likewise every base will form a conjugate acid after accepting an H + in a reaction, and they together for a conjugate acid-base pair.  What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH 4 not an acid while HCl is? The truth is that every compound with a hydrogen atom is potentially an acid, but some of them are so weak that we don’t consider them to be an acid (CH 4 is an example of this). The strength of an acid is related to the stability of its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is very stable, then it is easy for the acid to lose an H + and form its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is an anion that we’ve seen before (monoatomic or polyatomic), then it’s stable. In the case of , its conjugate base would be . This is unstable because it would put a negative charge on a carbon atom, something we’ve never seen before (reminder: carbon isn’t very electronegative and thus wouldn’t like to have excess electrons). Negative charges can exist on highly electronegative elements such as the halogens and oxygen. If a molecule has a positive charge and has a hydrogen atom, it can often act as an acid since losing the H + can stabilize the molecule by also removing the positive charge (ex.   In order for a molecule to act as a base, the molecule must have a lone pair of electrons in order to form a new bond with the H + that it would accept. In addition, the conjugate acid must be stable. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms often have lone pairs of electrons and are especially good at accepting H + . Also, molecules that have a negative charge and lone pairs of electrons are often good bases because if they accept an H + , the negative charge will get neutralized (ex. ).  "

  "body": " Water   Summary:     Water can act as an acid or a base in a reaction    There is a relationship between the amount of hydronium and hydroxide ions in an aqueous solution    We can use the Kw equation to determine the concentration of hydroxide and hydronium ions in a solution     Water can be an acid or a base   We already learned that acids donate H + or increase the concentration of H + in solution. This is a bit of an oversimplification. In water, H + essentially doesn’t exist, because it very rapidly undergoes a reaction with water that is shown below:     H 3 O + is a polyatomic ion called hydronium ion . Chemists will typically use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably, so just be aware that H + really means H 3 O + if the acid is in water. Another term to be aware of is that H + is sometimes called a “proton”. Why? Well most hydrogen atoms have 1 proton, no neutrons, and 1 electron…take away the electron to form H + and all you have leftover is 1 proton.  We’ve discussed the definition of an acid and a base and have seen examples of what happens when acids or bases are mixed with water. In this section, we’re going to have a bit more formal treatment of what happens when an acid or base is mixed with water. See the chart below:          What is being mixed with water  Water acts as a…  Water becomes…  Example reaction    Acid (Strong or weak)  Base  Hydronium ion     Strong Base  Acid  Hydroxide ion     Weak Base  Acid  Hydroxide ion       Note: when nitrogen containing bases are mixed with water, the product is a salt with hydroxide. The base accepts a proton from water and forms an ionic compound with the leftover hydroxide as shown in the table above and the additional reactions below:      So nitrogen containing bases that are aqueous can be written as salts with hydroxide. However, they are weak bases so the reactant form also remains. Either form is appropriate to write as shown in the table below:         Nitrogen containing base examples  Form 1  Form 2                    Since water can act both as an acid and a base, we can write the following reaction where one water is an acid and another is a base. This reaction is continually happening in a sample of liquid water:     So in a sample of water, there is always some hydronium ion and some hydroxide ion. If water is neutral (ie. not acidic or basic), then the concentration of hydroxide and hydronium ions are equal. If water is acidic (for instance, if an acid is added to water), then extra hydronium ion has been produced and the amount of hydronium ion exceeds the amount of hydroxide ion. If the water is basic, (for instance, if a base is added to water), then extra hydroxide ions have been produced and the amount of hydroxide exceeds the amount of hydronium ions. There is an inverse relationship between the amount of hydroxide and hydronium ions in solution. If we multiply their concentrations (measured in molarity), we get a constant, K w , which has a value of 1x10 -14 at 25 o C. This is shown by the equation below. In the equation, the brackets indicate that these are the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide, measured in molarity. Note: it is crucial that you use the concentrations in molarity and not any other unit for this calculation. K w is a unitless value (even though it seems like it should have units of M 2 ) but the reason why is beyond the scope of this course.     This equation can be used to find the concentration of hydroxide or hydronium ion, if we’re given the concentration of the other one. It can also be used to find the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions in a neutral solution as shown below:  Since it’s neutral,   Therefore, becomes   So   "

Ionic equations can be used to represent neutalization reactions     Neutralization reactions for monoprotic acids and bases   The other class of reaction that we’ve seen before in this chapter is a neutralization reaction. Here we’ll cover it in more detail. If the neutralization reaction is between a strong acid and strong base, then the products will be water and a salt as shown in the equations below:  Chemical equation:     Ionic equation:     Net ionic equation:     Any neutralization reaction involving a strong acid reacting with a strong base will have an ionic equation of:       Steps to writing a neutralization reaction     Break the reactants into their ions     is a covalent compound and thus won’t break apart into ions. There is no hydroxide it can lose.      Identify the acid and the base    When identifying the acid and the base, H + will always be an acid and OH - will always be a base (in your class, at least)    If the acid is a polyatomic ion (ie. one of the polyatomic ions with “hydrogen” in the name, then break off the hydrogen ion (example: breaks into and ))      React the acid and the base. H + and OH - will combine together (if present) to form water, but in some cases the base may be something other than hydroxide. In those cases, have the hydrogen ion react with whatever other base is present.    Look at what ions you have left over (and what new ion you may have formed)    Write these ions in the products (if you’re being asked for an ionic equation)    Delete any ions that didn’t change in the reaction (if you’re being asked for a net ionic equation)    Combine the ions together to form an ionic compound (if you’re being asked for the chemical equation)       To write a neutralization reaction, like we just did above, we first split acid and base into their ions. Then we allowed the acid (H + ) to react with the base (OH - ) to form water. This results in ions being left over (the spectator ions). Those ions are    Combined together to form the chemical equation,    Left alone as separate ions (to form the ionic equation), or    Deleted in both the reactants and products to form the net ionic equation    Neutralization reactions can follow slightly different patterns when the base is NOT hydroxide. For instance, if the base is ammonia ( ), then we need to first recognize that this is a covalent compound, not an ionic compound. Thus it won’t split into ions in the first step. See the example below:   If we react with , after step one, we’d have . At this point the acidic ion will react with the basic to form . The product would then contain and the left over We can then write the equation in the following ways:  Ionic equation:     Net ionic equation (get rid of the chloride spectator ion):     Chemical equation (combine the ions in the products together to make a compound):      As a final nuance, we can also have cases where polyatomic ions can act as acids. In those cases, the polyatomic ion will have “hydrogen” as a part of its name. This hydrogen will be lost to the base. Therefore, this polyatomic ion must be broken apart by losing its H + . See the example below:   If we react with , after step one, we’d have . In step 2, the HCl is identified as the acid since it has an H + ion; therefore the sodium dihydrogen phosphate must be the base. At this point the acidic ion will react with the basic to form .

Calculations involving pH involve logarithms\/power functions     pH   When scientists describe how acidic or basic a solution is, we could report the concentration of hydronium ion or hydroxide ion. However, because the numbers are so small and usually written in scientific notation, this becomes quite cumbersome. To solve this problem, we instead often transform the concentration of hydronium ion into a pH value using the formula below:     This version of the equation can be used to find the pH value from a concentration of hydronium ion (which MUST be molarity). We can figure out the pH of a neutral solution as shown:     pH values lower than 7 are said to be acidic solutions. pH values above 7 are basic solutions. The reason why will be determined as a part of your exercises.   The pH scale    In some cases, we’ll need to figure out the concentration of hydronium ion from a pH value. This requires rearrangement of the pH equation using algebra skills. The tricky part of this is that we need to ‘undo’ the log function. This is done by taking 10 and raising it to the power of everything on that side of the equation as shown below:                 If the concentration of hydronium ion is 0.0044M, calculate the pH of the solution      2.4        If the concentration of hydroxide ion is 0.0044M, calculate the pH of the solution.    Use the Kw equation to find the hydronium ion concentration first.    11.6        If the pH of a solution is 4.3, calculate the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration. Which is greater?    Use the reverse pH equation to get the hydronium ion concentration. You can then get the hydroxide concentration using the Kw equation.    [hydronium]= , [hydroxide]= , hydronium ion concentration is higher        Repeat the same calculations, but at a pH value of 9.2.      [hydronium]= , [hydroxide]= , hydroxide ion concentration is higher        Compare the results of the last two problems. If the pH is greater than 7, is the hydronium or hydroxide ion concentration bigger? What about below pH 7?      The hydronium ion concentration is greater than the hydroxide ion concentration below pH 7. Above pH 7, the reverse is true.              If 1.00 g of HCl is added to 2.0 L water, what is the new pH?     Step 1: How many moles of HCl was added? How many moles of hydronium was added?

  "body": " Buffers   Summary:     Buffers help solutions resist changes in pH    Buffers are mixtures of weak acids and weak bases    Every buffered solution has a buffering capacity that describes how much acid or base it can handle     Buffers    Buffers are substances that can be added to water to make the water resistant to changes in pH. A buffer consists of either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. How does this mixture of substances make the solution more resistant to changes in pH?  When a strong acid is added to water, it will form hydronium ions and the concentration of the hydronium ions formed will be the same as the concentration of the acid that was just added, because a strong acid completely dissociates upon addition to water. Likewise if a strong base is added to water, it will form the number of hydroxide ions that are contained in that substance that was added, again because a strong base will completely dissociate when added to water. The additional hydronium ion or hydroxide ion will then directly affect the pH of the solution.  When a buffer is present, the solution contains an additional solute that is an acid and another that is a base. These acids and bases are capable of reacting with any base or acid that might get added to the solution, helping to neutralize it. The picture below might help.   How a buffer resists changes in pH from the addition of acid    Every buffer has a buffering capacity . This is the amount of additional acid or base that can be added without exceeding the amount of buffering compounds. So if a buffered solution contains 0.1M weak base and 0.2M of its conjugate acid, then the solution could handle the addition of up to 0.1M hydronium ions before running out of weak base (because the weak base will react with the hydronium ions) and up to 0.2M hydroxide ions (because the hydroxide would react with the conjugate acid). Amounts of hydronium above 0.1M would exceed the buffering capacity of the solution as would addition of more than 0.2M hydroxide ion.     Which of the following mixtures of chemicals would make good buffers?          Yes        \/      Yes             No    They are related by the addition\/removal of a proton. However, hydroxide is a strong base, not a weak base.           Yes             No    These compounds are related by the addition\/removal of a proton. However, HCl is a strong acid.      \/      Yes             No    These compounds are both weak acids. Neither is a base. Also neither has its conjugate base present.       Create a drawing similar to the figure above that shows how a buffer can resist changes to pH caused by adding in strong base.             If a solution contains 0.11 moles of weak base and 0.34 moles of weak acid, then ...     How many moles of nitric acid could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      0.11 moles        How many moles of sodium hydroxide could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      0.34 moles        How many moles of calcium hydroxide could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      0.17 moles        "

  "body": " Acid-base titrations   Summary:     Titrations are reactions used to determine the concentration of an unknown.    Mole-mole conversion factors from the balanced neutralization reaction     Acid-base titrations   An acid base titration is simply a solution reaction that is used to measure the concentration of an acid or base. If we begin with a known volume of solution with an unknown concentration of acid, we can determine its concentration by measuring the number of moles of base that we have to add to neutralize it. The easiest way to do that is to slowly add a solution of base of known concentration to the solution using a burette, which allows us to measure the volume of base needed. If we have the volume and concentration of the base, we can use this to determine the number of moles of base. From there, we can convert moles of base to moles of acid using the balanced chemical equation. If we know moles of acid and its volume (remember we need to know this when we start the titration), then we can divide them to determine the concentration.  Up to this point, the acid-base neutralization equations that we’ve been working with have had a 1:1 ratio of acid to base. With some acids and bases, this ratio may not be 1:1. Consider calcium hydroxide, . Each unit of calcium hydroxide contains 2 hydroxide ions. Each one of these bases must be neutralized by a separate hydrogen ion from the acid. Thus 2 acidic ions will be required to neutralize one calcium hydroxide. As with any stoichiometric calculation, we must ensure that we have a balanced equation first to give us the proper mole-mole ratios for our calculations.     7.50 mL of an HCl solution was neutralized by the addition of 14.30mL of 0.0980 M NaOH.

  "body": " Definitions   Chapter 1      Natural world: Everything that comprises our universe. The natural world are those things that we can see and touch. The natural world can be explored through science.         Supernatural: Those things that are outside of nature or the laws of physics. We can learn about supernatural things by logical reasoning, philosophy, and theology.         Potency: Potency is the potential to change in some specific way. Natural things have the potency of motion. They aren’t necessarily moving initially, but after the potential of motion is actualized by something else, the thing is now moving.         Actuality: Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. For instance, a spark has the ability to cause a paper to start on fire. The spark possesses the property of being able to actualize the fire. The paper possesses the potency of burning.         Actus Purus: Actus Purus means pure actuality. It is something that possesses the property of actuality without any potency. Actus Purus can cause change in other things but cannot be changed itself.         Superstition: Superstitition is a sin of excess excess religion. Often superstition involves a person seeking to control the supernatural by means of magic, sorcery, the occult, etc.         Scandal: an attitude or behavior that leads another to do evil.         Holistic: emphasizing the whole and showing concern about each of the component parts of a thing.         Science: a method for systematically studying the observable world.         Scientific method: A process that allows us to develop explanations for the observations about the natural world. The core steps are observe, hypothesize, and experiment.         Laws: statements that express a repeated pattern of behavior in nature. Laws do NOT seek to explain the cause of the behavior.         Hypothesis: A statement that seeks to explain observations of nature.         Variables: The parameter or condition that is changed within an experiment.         Control groups: The groups within an experiment where the variable is unchanged. Positive controls attempt to cause the behavior to ensure that it can be observed. Negative controls often withhold the variable to allow for observation of what the behavior is in the absence of the variable.         Experimental groups: Experimental groups include the variable and often involve changing it in some way (ex. amount of the variable, exposure time to the variable, etc.).         Theory: A hypothesis that has substantial experimental support. Theories can never be proven. They can be supported to greater and greater degrees, but they can never reach absolute certainty.         Correlation: Correlation is when we observe a pattern or relationship between changing a variable and the observed response. For instance, if increasing the amount of an antibiotic leads to greater observation of bacterial cell death, we’d say that the antibiotic amount correlates with bacterial cell death.         Deify: Deify means to treat something like a God. In this case, I mean that science has begun to replace God in the minds of many people in today’s society. People look to science for solutions to all of their problems. People also look to science to find explanations about humanity’s purpose and dignity (or lack thereof) within the context of nature.         Consensus: A consensus is a general belief amongst scientists that a particular theory is true. This is arrived at by comparing the quality of experiments and their conclusions throughout the scientific community as well as the number of studies that support a particular conclusion.         Bias: A preference that prevents fair judgment.         Engineering: Engineering seeks to solve problems by creating solutions. It relies of science to explain how things work so that engineering can figure out how to use them to solve a problem.         Politics: Politics is not a major focus of this course. However, politics is related to science an engineering because politics should seek the welfare of the people in society. Politics can encourage the use of engineering to solve problems and can encourage scientific discovery, both of which can be used for political goals.         Activists: One who tries to influence public opinion. Scientists can potentially do this in ethical ways or unethical ways.         Chemistry: Chemistry studies the properties of matter. This includes how matter interacts with energy, how matter is structures, how matter behaves in a variety of conditions, etc.         Matter: Matter is difficult to define exactly. Our definition is that matter must have mass and occupy space. It is essentially the “stuff” that is in the universe.         Mass: Mass is difficult to define in physics. If something has inertia (the ability to resist changes in movement) or exerts gravitational attraction to other objects, then that object has mass. Mass can be quantified to determine the extent to which an object has inertia or can exhibit gravitational attraction.       Chapter 2      Numerator: the top of a fraction.         Denominator: the bottom of a fraction.         Dividend: the number that is being divided.         Divisor: the number of parts that the dividend is being divided into.         Coefficient: the leading part of scientific notation. It should always be a number between 1 and 10 and should be written as a decimal.         Base: follows the coefficient in scientific notation. The coefficient is multiplied by the base. The base is always 10 raised to some integer power.         Exact number: a value that is countable, a definition, or a desired quantity. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures.         Measured number: a value that was measured and thus isn't known exactly. Every measured number has a non-zero amount of uncertainty.         Significant figures: the digits in a number that both convey its quantity and that are known reliably.         Analog: An analog device is one that uses markings to measure a value. An example would be a clock with hand and markings for the hours and minutes.        Digital: A digital device is one that displays a measurement using digits only.       Chapter 3    Chapter 4    Chapter 5    Chapter 6    Chapter 7    Chapter 8    Chapter 9    Chapter 10      Hydronium ion: A cation that forms when acids react with water. It has the formula          Buffer: Substances that can be added to water that help the solution resist changes in pH. Buffers are mixtures of weak acids and their conjugate base.         Buffering capacity: The amount of strong acid or strong base that a buffer can neutralize.         Titration: The process of using a chemical reaction to figure out the concentration or amount of an unknown sample.      "
