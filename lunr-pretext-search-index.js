  "title": "Purpose",
  "body": "Purpose  This textbook is intended for collegiate pre-nursing students as a part of a two semester course in General, Organic, and Biological chemistry. The first ten chapters of this text is also appropriate for high school students as a first chemistry course and pairs with the Franciscan Advantage program in chemistry that is offered by Franciscan University of Steubenville.  I believe that this textbook is unique in that it pairs active-learning in chemistry with a Catholic-Christian understanding of science and chemistry. Active learning is an educational term that encompasses many different approaches, but importantly means that the student is actively engaged in learning rather than listening to lectures.  This textbook is divided into chapters. Each chapter is further divided into lessons (which are appropriate for a 50 min college class or perhaps several days worth of a high school class). Within each lesson are several sections, each of which teaches a different concept. The sections contain a text lesson, which should ideally be read by the student before class. Each section ends with several exercises which are designed to be completed during class, with the help of peers or the instructor. Studies have repeatedly shown that students learn better and retain knowledge better when they are actively engaged in learning new material rather than simply having it presented to them.  This text also aims to incorporate a Catholic-Christian understanding of science, philosophy, and ethics. The first chapter of the textbook focuses heavily on this, but there are additional places throughout the textbook where the relevance of the lesson to our faith and morals is discussed further.  To further aid in student learning, this textbook includes helpful online video instruction to accompany the various chapters and lessons in the textbook. These videos are freely available on YouTube, and teachers and students are encouraged to utilize them where they deem appropriate.  "

  "title": "Learning in an Active Classroom",
  "body": "Learning in an Active Classroom  This textbook is designed for use in an Active Learning environment. This may be different than other classes that you’re used to taking in that there is substantially less lecturing from your instructor and more emphasis on you learning by actively participating in the learning process. This requires that you listen and take notes when your instructor is teaching, just as you would in any class. Even more important, though, is that you complete all of the exercises in this text. These should be completed before you go on to the next section, since much of science builds upon prior knowledge and skills.  When completing the exercises, you should be aware of the following guidelines:   Always WRITE down your responses to each question and include any work. If you struggled with this problem, your work should include notes to help you remember how you solved the problem. Writing helps you commit your responses to memory and provides an invaluable study aid for quizzes and\/or exams.    If you are struggling with a problem, first ask your group for help. If your group cannot solve the problem, ask your instructor for help. Reaching out for help is an essential skill in an active learning environment and throughout life!    Always make sure to check your answer with the key in the textbook. Everyone makes mistakes! The only way to correct them is to know that you made a mistake in the first place.    If you get help, write down notes about the help you receive!    Do not skip or ignore any exercise problem. They are all there for a reason!    Don’t be afraid to struggle! There’s no shame in not understanding something. The real failure is if you give up.     In an active learning classroom group work is highly encouraged. Not only does it give you an opportunity to help others, but it strengthens learning by requiring you to be able to explain the concepts that you’re learning about. Also, if you are the one who is having to ask the questions, forming fraternal bonds with your classmates can help you through your struggles in a class and ensure that you always have multiple sources of help available to you. On the other hand, if you’re the one explaining a concept to a fellow group member, make sure that they understand what you are saying and be patient with them if they continue to struggle. It’s all too common to have a student respond “Oh I get it now” when they don’t fully grasp what you said. Don’t be afraid to struggle!  Group work can have pitfalls if you don’t utilize it properly. It’s the responsibility of each member of the group to contribute to the exercises, to ensure that they understand the material being covered, and to ensure that their fellow group members understand the material. If you don’t understand a concept, keep asking for help until you do. Don’t just rush through the exercises and assume that because the group got the answers right that you also understand the concept or how to solve the problem. Again, don’t be afraid to struggle!   Exercise: Learning in an active classroom     Write down the 6 guidelines to completing exercises in an active classroom. Why is each one of these guidelines important?    Introduce yourself to your group members (no need to write anything down for this one, unless you want to). Suggested information includes your name, hometown, major, hobbies, etc. You may find yourself in a different group from time-to-time. Always take time to introduce yourself to people who are new to you and to learn about them as well. If you’re completing this course on your own (ex. in a homeschool environment), make sure to find someone knowledgeable in chemistry who you can reach out to. Also you can always reach out to the author, Dr. James Vranish, by emailing him at jvranish@franciscan.edu .      "

  "title": "Relationship between the natural and the supernatural",
  "body": " Relationship between the natural and the supernatural   Summary:     Relationship between the natural and the supernatural    What is meant by the natural and supernatural    The existence of the natural world is dependent on a supernatural cause    Christians hold the natural and supernatural to both be important       Section 1: Natural and the Supernatural   In this textbook, I’m going to be assuming that the reader acknowledges the existence of the Christian God and His Son, Jesus Christ. My discussions of faith, science, and ethics will come from the theological tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, but will have a lot in common with other Christian denominations. If there are areas in the text that seem to be at odd with your own personal beliefs, I hope the information contained in here can serve as a starting point for further discussions and debates.  Catholics acknowledge Jesus and thus can’t separate their discussions of the natural world  Everything that comprises our universe. The natural world are those things that we can see and touch. The natural world can be explored through science. from the supernatural  Those things that are outside of nature or the laws of physics. We can learn about supernatural things by logical reasoning, philosophy, and theology. (bolded text is usually indicating an important term that you SHOULD know the definition of. In this textbook, definitions and extra commentary are provided as footnotes at the bottom of the page). Both the natural and supernatural are components of reality and are interdependent. Catholics acknowledge the existence of God, and thus existence that is beyond nature, in other words, the supernatural. As St. Thomas Aquinas argues in his Summa Theologica , the creation of the natural world presupposes a supernatural cause; nature cannot be the first cause. He argues this at length through the “first mover” argument. In this argument he establishes that the natural world is dependent on God for its existence. This argument goes something like this:    The natural world is full of motion. Matter moves, time moves, etc.    All motion must have a prior cause.    Natural things have the potential to move, that is they have potency  Potency is the potential to change in some specific way. Natural things have the potency of motion. They aren’t necessarily moving initially, but after the potential of motion is actualized by something else, the thing is now moving. . That potential can be realized through the action of some outside cause. Natural things also have actuality  Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. For instance, a spark has the ability to cause a paper to start on fire. The spark possesses the property of being able to actualize the fire. The paper possesses the potency of burning. , the ability to bring forth potency (ie. natural things can cause other natural things to move). The bringing forth of potency is a change in that thing.    There must be a first actuality to bring forth all motion. That actuality can’t have potency, otherwise it would have had to be acted on by something else first. We can summarize this by saying that there must be a “first mover”.    There is a philosophical need for an actor that can actualize motion but remain unchangeable. We call this actor God. God must therefore lack potency (He doesn’t change). Instead, God is pure actuality ( Actus Purus  Actus Purus means pure actuality. It is something that possesses the property of actuality without any potency. Actus Purus can cause change in other things but cannot be changed itself. ). He can initiate change or motion but can’t be acted upon or changed by other things.    Actus purus must initiate all motion. Therefore God must have initiate all of nature.    After having established the existence of the supernatural in addition to the natural world, many questions arise about the importance of each and the relationship between them (example: miracles). In many ways, the Catholic faith is grounded in the supernatural. God has a supernatural nature and is both the Creator and Redeemer. Humanity is dependent on Him for existence, and the hope for eternal life rests solely in Him. Because of the supremacy of God’s supernatural nature, one might argue that the best thing that each of us can do with our lives is to put all of effort into understanding the supernatural, thus minimizing the importance of the material world. Indeed portions of scripture could be interpreted as saying that this is the approach that Catholics should take. Two examples:   “Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” 1 John 2:15   “’Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?  Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?  Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?  Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.  But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.  If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?  So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’  All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.  But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.” Matthew 6: 25-33.  So, should we all study theology and scorn the study of the natural world? Hopefully it is obvious to you that this view is incomplete and thus misguided…but why?     Summarize the first mover argument in your own words.      Answers may vary (see the argument in the text to check for similarity to what you stated).        Explain the terms potency, actuality, and Actus Purus in your own words. What is the relationship between the three terms?      Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. Potency is some change that can be realized in a thing. Actus Purus is a term for God that describes Him as pure actuality without potency. Actuality brings forth potency. The first actualization must have been from Actus Purus.        Would most superheroes be best classified as natural or supernatural? They are clearly exceptional, but are they supernatural?      They are exceptional but natural. They can be seen and touched. Their powers often work within nature (example: spiderman can only swing because of his webs).        Are angels natural or supernatural? Do angels possess potency, actuality, or both?      Angels are supernatural (example: they donâ€™t exist in one particular space; their movement defies the laws of physics). Angels can change and therefore possess potency. They can also influence other things and thus have actuality.        Is everything that is supernatural Actus Purus?      Angels are an example of something that is supernatural that nonetheless possesses potency. Only God is Actus Purus.        As Catholics, we believe that God is not exclusively supernatural. We believe that Jesus is the unity of the supernatural and the natural in one person. How does this knowledge inform the way in which we should approach the relationship between the natural and the supernatural as Catholics? Is one more important than the other?      Human nature and human bodies are a part of God, through his Son, Jesus. God is therefore body and spirit, natural and supernatural. If we are to love God, we must love both parts. In caring for others, we must care for their bodily and spiritual needs.        Catholics are called to be separate from the world, yet we are material creatures. What are ways in which we can practically abandon materialism?      When we say we should abandon materialism, we mean that we should abandon unhealthy attachments. For instance, food is good, but gluttony is sinful. We can avoid gluttony by practicing occasional fasting.       "

  "title": "The greatest commandment",
  "body": " The greatest commandment   Summary:     The greatest commandment    Love God and love your neighbor as yourself    In order to holistically love our neighbor, we must care for their natural and supernatural needs       Section 2: The Greatest Commandment   In scripture, Jesus gives us the Greatest Commandment:   “[Jesus] said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.  This is the greatest and the first commandment.  The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” Matthew 22:37-39  Each of us lives and acts in the natural world. God gives us his commandments to help us live according to His will. The greatest commandment unites the supernatural and natural world into one rule for us. We should love God, and when we love one another, we are loving God by loving them. Humans are body (natural) and soul (supernatural). If we are to love our neighbor in a holistic  Holistic means emphasizing the whole and showing concern about each of the component parts of a thing. way, we must show concern for their natural and supernatural needs. This is reflected in in the following passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:   “All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and love.  Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.” Catechism of the Catholic Church 1878  How do we care for the material needs of others? In many cases this is obvious. All people need food, water, and shelter. Providing access to quality healthcare is another way in which we love our neighbor through natural means. As Catholics, we should strive to ensure that our care for neighbor is not solely a material benefit, but a spiritual one as well. By incorporating empathy, compassion, friendship, and brotherly\/sisterly love into our material service to one another, we ensure that we are holistically loving our neighbor and serving their needs in the best possible way. The Catholic Church clearly shows us ways that we can care for the body and soul of our neighbor through the lists of corporal (bodily) and spiritual works of mercy.        Corporal works of mercy  Spiritual works of mercy    Feed the hungry  Counsel the doubtful    Give drink to the thirsty  Instruct the ignorant    Clothe the naked  Admonish sinners    Shelter the homeless  Comfort the afflicted    Visit the sick  Forgive offenses    Visit the imprisoned  Bear wrongs patiently    Bury the dead  Pray for the living and the dead     There are other less obvious ways in which we are also called to love our neighbor. Human beings are part of creation and exist within the environment around them. We must therefore show love to neighbor by ALSO showing respect for Creation. This is emphasized in the following quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as well as a couple of Papal encyclicals:   “The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.  Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.” Catechism of the Catholic Church 2415   “The environment is God's gift to everyone, and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole… In nature, the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God's creative activity, which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs, material or otherwise, while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation.” Caritas in Veritate 48.   “The created things of this world are not free of ownership: ‘For they are yours, O Lord, who love the living’ (Wis 11:26). This is the basis of our conviction that, as part of the universe, called into being by one Father, all of us are linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect.” Laudato si 89.   “Moreover, when our hearts are authentically open to universal communion, this sense of fraternity excludes nothing and no one. It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty towards any creature is ‘contrary to human dignity’. We can hardly consider ourselves to be fully loving if we disregard any aspect of reality: ‘Peace, justice and the preservation of creation are three absolutely interconnected themes, which cannot be separated and treated individually without once again falling into reductionism’” Laudato si 92.   Exercise: The Greatest Commandment     The Greatest Commandment sounds like two commandments. Explain why this is not the case.    Explain what I mean when I say that we are called to holistically love our neighbor.    Imagine that you receive healthcare in a clinic that is exceptional in healing you but is simultaneously cold and impersonal. How would you feel? Come up with concrete ideas for how you could prevent a patient from feeling this way if you were a medical professional.    Explain a concrete way in which our respect for the environment can manifest itself as love of neighbor. Similarly, explain a concrete way in which abuse of the environment can manifest itself in harming our neighbor.     Key:   Exercise:    When we love one another, we love God’s creation and our neighbors. We cannot fully love God, without loving everything that comes from Him, including creation and our neighbors.    We are each body and spirit. In order to love our neighbor, we must show compassionate care for both their body and spirit.    I probably wouldn’t be very happy. I might feel disrespected or as-if I was just a source of income for the hospital\/doctor. If a doctor takes the time to have a real conversation with a patient rather than rushing through a visit, this can help to fulfill the spiritual needs to companionship that the patient has.    Picking up garbage along a hiking trail can help the next visitor more fully enjoy the beauty of God’s creation. Throwing away toxic chemicals can lead to them entering bodies of water that people swim in or get their drinking water from. This can lead to health problems for your neighbor.    "

  "body": " What is science?   Summary:     Science is a methodology for investigating the natural world    Laws vs. hypotheses vs. theories    Scientific method    Observations lead to hypotheses which leads to experiments which leads to more observations      Science is something that everyone does, even if they don’t realize it       Section 1: What is science?    Science  Science is a method for systematically studying the observable world. is a methodology that allows us to learn about nature. People have been doing science since the beginning of mankind. The development of tools, hunting methods, agriculture, etc. were all dependent on knowledge gained through science. The methodology used for science wasn’t rigorously defined until 1620 when Francis Bacon published his work Novum Organum. Further refinements and definitions have led to what we now call the scientific method  A process that allows us to develop explanations for the observations about the natural world. The core steps are observe, hypothesize, and experiment. . This process begins with making observations about the natural world. These observations can lead to laws or hypotheses. Laws  Laws are statements that express a repeated pattern of behavior in nature. Laws do NOT seek to explain the cause of the behavior. are statements about patterns invariably observed in nature (you can basically think of them as an observation with elite status). They are rules that seek to explain what will happen in a given circumstance based on what has been observed again and again, without exception. A common example of a law is the law of gravity. It can be described in different ways: “what goes up must come down”, “objects with mass attract one another”, or even with a mathematical equation ( ). Note that these descriptions predict what will happen and may even provide a quantitative prediction, but they do NOT explain why. Laws do NOT have to be formalized in textbooks, though. For instance, I’d like to point out that most of us are familiar with the “law of glowing red metal” that states that glowing red metal is quite hot and probably shouldn’t be touched.  The scientific method starts with an observation or law, but progresses further by seeking to explain why nature behaves in the way it does. A statement that seeks to explain the causes of natural phenomena that is based on observations or laws is called a hypothesis  A statement that seeks to explain observations of nature. . A hypothesis is an explanation that has not been suitably tested. In order to lend support to a hypothesis, scientists often carry out experiments. A properly designed experiment tests the effect of a limited number of variables  The parameter or condition that is changed within an experiment. (ie. something that is changed, and therefore tested in an experiment) while striving to keep everything else as identical as possible. In a properly designed experiment, there are always a minimum of two possible groups: controls and experimental groups. The control groups  The groups within an experiment where the variable is unchanged. Positive controls attempt to cause the behavior to ensure that it can be observed. Negative controls often withhold the variable to allow for observation of what the behavior is in the absence of the variable. serve as comparisons, showing what the outcome is if the variable is ignored\/absent\/unchanged. The experimental group  Experimental groups include the variable and often involve changing it in some way (ex. amount of the variable, exposure time to the variable, etc.) consists of groups where the variable is changed. By comparing the results between the controls and experimental groups, we can reach conclusions about whether the experiment supports or refutes our hypothesis. Importantly, experiments can NEVER prove a hypothesis to be correct, instead they allow us to reject alternative explanations.  When interpreting the results of experiments and trying to develop explanations for the causes of an observation, one of the principles that guides all of science is known as Ockham’s razor, which states that the simplest explanation that is consistent with known experimental results is the one that should be held. William of Ockham, the namesake of Ockham’s razor, was a Catholic Franciscan friar in the 14 th century, and made several contributions to philosophy and theology. This further highlights the relationship between science, philosophy, and theology; the very roots of scientific thought and logic are grounded in philosophical and theological principles.  Using Ockham’s razor, scientists can begin to piece together models that explain their observations. These models can lead to further hypotheses and experiments. If a hypothesis has withstood numerous experiments, it can be considered to be a theory  A hypothesis that has substantial experimental support. Theories can never be proven. They can be supported to greater and greater degrees, but they can never reach absolute certainty. . A theory is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested (a single experiment or test is rarely enough) and has NEVER been shown to be inconsistent with an experimental result. Experimental results that conflict with a hypothesis do NOT have to lead to outright rejection of the hypothesis and often instead lead to revision or addition of clarifications or exceptions. The distinction between a hypothesis and a theory is subjective and open to interpretation, but scientists all agree that enough experiments should have been carried out to allow obvious alternate explanations to be rejected.  An example of the scientific method in action:  A carpenter observes that wood is a strong building material that is capable of holding a large amount of weight and wants to understand why. The carpenter hypothesizes that thick wood is capable of holding more weight than thin wood. To test this, the carpenter sets up a control group consisting of wood with a standard thickness and experimental groups that have wood with other thicknesses (either thicker or thinner). He then tests each group by observing how many books each piece of wood can hold before breaking. His results show that thin boards hold less weight than thick boards. We’d say that board thickness correlates  Correlation is when we observe a pattern or relationship between changing a variable and the observed response. For instance, if increasing the amount of an antibiotic leads to greater observation of bacterial cell death, we’d say that the antibiotic amount correlates with bacterial cell death. with board strength. While this result supports his hypothesis, there are still other possible explanations for the result. For instance, perhaps the process used for reducing the thickness of the boards damaged the wood by introducing cracks. Alternatively, the thin pieces of wood might have had more (or fewer) wood grains and that might instead have been the source of the observed outcomes. . Correlation does not equal causation!   Exercise 1: What is science?     Come up with 3 additional laws of nature that you have encountered in your own life that you won’t find listed in a science textbook.    Come up with 3 ways in which you used the scientific method in your own life without realizing what you were doing.    Look around you right now. Observe something and write it down. Try to develop a hypothesis that explains that observation. Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. Why controls would you need? What results would you expect that would validate your hypothesis?    Why is it important to develop alternative explanations to experimental observations?    It is seen that lead exposure levels correlate with crime rates. Does this mean that lead exposure causes crime? If not, what come up with some alternative explanations.     Key:   Exercise:      The law of melting butter. When you heat butter, it turns into a liquid.    The law of successful campfires. Camp fires burn best when they have adequate ventilation near the bottom.    The law of autumn. Leaves turn from green to yellow, orange, or red in the fall.        I try out different amounts of time when frying eggs to see whether the yolk is hard or runny. (experiment)    I observe that when I hit the up volume button on the remote control, the TV gets louder (observation)    I think that my lawn is turning brown because it needs more water (hypothesis)      Light is coming through various sized slits in the blinds in my room. I think that light can always pass through any gap, no matter how small. I get two objects that can move to change the gap size between them. I place a light behind them and observe if the light can pass through at various gap sizes. A negative control would be if the objects were pressed together so no gap exists. A positive control would be the light itself without the objects to create the gap (to just make sure that I can see the light and that it’s working.    These can remind us that scientific theories are never certain. Also, they can help us design new experiments to add greater certainty to theories (or possibly to prove them wrong).    Not necessarily. Perhaps people who are exposed to higher levels of lead tend to be more impoverished. Perhaps that poverty is the root cause of the high crime rate.    "

  "body": " Faith, Science, Engineering, and Politics   Summary:     The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics    Science is an essential part of what makes us human    Science and faith are complementary and not at odds with one another    Faith should lead us to use science in good and just ways    What is meant by the deification of science    What are some ways in which science has built mistrust      Science, engineering, and politics are interdependent       Section 2: The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics   The modern world is obsessed with science. It is easy to think of science as a modern marvel, and indeed some people have begun to deify  Deify means to treat it like a God. In this case, I mean that science has begun to replace God in the minds of many people in today’s society. People look to science for solutions to all of their problems. People also look to science to find explanations about humanity’s purpose and dignity (or lack thereof) within the context of nature. it. The discoveries of scientists have in many cases dramatically improved life for people around the world and promise to work wonders such as the eradication of disease (even if some of these promises seem far off). Many of the observations of nature that in history appeared miraculous now have scientific explanations and theories. For instance, the variety of life of Earth is now widely believed (even amongst Catholic scientists) to have resulted from evolution rather than a single creation event (it’s worth noting, less you think of this as a source of conflict between faith and science that Catholic scientists still believe in a Creation event, but that the events that followed and their timing differ from a literal reading of Genesis). Because of this, many people have come to reject religion as superstitious nonsense, since science appears (to some) as if it might be able to explain all natural phenomena. Many modern atheists use statements like this to argue that if God is not necessary to explain anything in nature, then it doesn’t make sense to believe in the existence of God. They of course forget that science is a tool for investigating only what can be observed in nature , and therefore it’s incapable of investigating the existence God. Furthermore, as we learned about in the previous lesson, supernatural causes are a logical necessity for the existence of nature. Additionally, the scientific method depends on change for experiments to work (recall that changes are actualization of some potency). All changes must ultimately have their root in Actus Purus…something that modern atheists conveniently ignore.  On the other extreme, many people are prone to reject scientific progress for a variety of reasons. Indeed, scientific investigations and technological “advances” have created numerous problems for society, and it is understandable why people have developed a distrust of science as a result. In the 1920s, a scientist named Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered that the addition of a chemical compound containing lead into gasoline could help it burn in a more reliable way in car engines. Leaded gasoline was thus introduced and was used in the United States until 1996. Over that time, vast quantities of lead were released into the environment and resulted in a variety of toxic effect. In a different example, in the Tuskegee syphilis study, several hundred black men with syphilis in the United States had treatment unknowingly withheld from them so that scientists could study the long-term effects of the disease. Once the details of this horrendous study came to light, it understandably had a negative impact on the trust of black Americans for the American medical community   The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Volume 133, Issue 1, February 2018, Pages 407–455 .  Nowadays, there are many prominent examples of mistrust between the scientific community and various groups of people. Global warming and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are two prominent areas. In this text, I’ll neither argue for or against those issues, but instead focus on the root cause of the distrust. Some of the distrust stems from the fact that different scientific studies can sometimes arrive at different conclusions. The reasons for this are complex and varied, but so are the subjects being studied.  For instance, one study might show that chemical X causes cancer while another study doesn’t. This disagreement might be due to differences in the amounts of chemical X used in the study, the amount of time of the exposure, the use of mice vs. rabbits, the type of test used, etc. Cancer is a very complex disease, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the studies and factors that influence its occurrence are complex as well.  Similarly, in the field of climatology (the study of climate) there are studies and data that show evidence of man’s role in global warming and other data that disputes this. Can science come to meaningful conclusions then? In cases where different studies have different outcomes and conclusions, the scientific community tries to carry out more and better designed studies in an effort to arrive at a consensus  A consensus is a general belief amongst scientists that a particular theory is true. This is arrived at by comparing the quality of experiments and their conclusions throughout the scientific community as well as the number of studies that support a particular conclusion. . , but a consensus represents the belief that the majority of the best studies support a particular theory.  The bias  A preference that prevents fair judgment of researchers can also play a role in science. An ethical scientist tries to avoid bias, but it can be difficult to eliminate entirely, especially since the importance of a scientific discovery is often linked to funding. In some cases, bias can and has led to incorrect interpretations of data, outright falsification of data, and entirely incorrect conclusions. However, bias is present in pretty much every part of life, with examples ranging from restaurant preferences to political decision making. Bias shouldn’t be a reason to distrust all scientists and scientific theories, but it is important to scrutinize scientific conclusions, especially when they begin to impact our lives, the lives of others, and\/or our environment.  Another reason for distrust of science has to deal with a misunderstanding of what science is. I would argue that much of the disagreement and distrust of science in our society is not at science at all, but rather at engineering  Engineering seeks to solve problems by creating solutions. It relies of science to explain how things work so that engineering can figure out how to use them to solve a problem. and even more so politics  Politics is not a major focus of this course. However, politics is related to science an engineering because politics should seek the welfare of the people in society. Politics can encourage the use of engineering to solve problems and can encourage scientific discovery, both of which can be used for political goals. . Engineering and science are closely related and interdependent fields. Where science seeks answers to the causes of things, engineering seeks to use that knowledge to create solutions to problems. Politics is related to both fields since our political leaders strive (or should strive) to find the best ways to use scientific knowledge and engineering creations to further the good of society.  As an example, let’s take the example of the Covid vaccines. A combination of scientific discoveries and engineering advancements lead to the development of the first Covid vaccines. Their purpose was to combat the Covid-19 virus, which was rapidly spreading across the globe. The disease was poorly understood and was able to cause death, hence the desire for rapid vaccine development (a political decision). The development of the vaccine was extremely rapid, thanks to many advances in biochemical engineering and science. Political pressure led to the implementation of the vaccine before thorough testing by scientists and engineers had been accomplished. Vaccine mandates followed, and whether justified or not, they were undoubtedly controversial. Again, though, vaccine mandates are not science, they are political actions. Many people have argued that the vaccines were untested, ineffective, and potentially harmful and that science failed in these regards. I would argue that scientists and engineers did not fail at all, but actually performed extraordinarily well. The scientific method takes considerable time and in the case of the Covid vaccine, due to political decisions, much of the discoveries of scientists lagged behind the roll out of the vaccines and their mandatory implementation. Indeed, scientists can’t test the effectiveness and safety of something that hasn’t been created yet. The decision to roll out the vaccines before the typical years worth of testing were complete wasn’t a decision of scientists but one of politicians. Many scientists definitely contributed to those political decisions, but it’s important to realize that they weren’t acting as scientists but as activists  One who tries to influence public opinion. Scientists can potentially do this in ethical ways or unethical ways. in those instances. Activists can act in ethical or unethical ways, and the same goes for scientists (and I’ll leave it to the reader to form their own opinions in this case). I’d even argue that activism is a necessity among scientists; if scientists can’t advocate for the importance of their research, then it won’t get the funding or support that is needed to carry it out (in many ways this is like a small business owner advertising a new product…but I digress…). Now, years after the vaccine rollout, biologists have largely reached a consensus about the effectiveness and safety of the Covid-19 vaccines. The majority of scientific research supports the conclusion that the initial vaccines weren’t very effective at preventing the spread of the disease, though they were effective in lessening its severity. Additionally, statistical analysis revealed that there are a variety of safety issues that correlated with the initial vaccines, though their rate of occurrence was quite low. The scientific method didn’t fail us, but it took time to carry out the studies and arrive at conclusions. Unfortunately, and perhaps unavoidably, the lines between science, engineering, and politics are often blurred and this can regrettably result in distrust in science and scientists for reasons that aren’t science at all.  When science and technology are deified, great error can result. On the other hand, lack of trust in scientists and their conclusions can lead to distrust and animosity and can potentially lead to the rejection of engineering advances that can help mankind. What then is the proper attitude to take towards science and its relationship to faith and human flouring? Read the following text from the Church’s Pastoral Constitution, Gaudium et Spes :  “Christians, on pilgrimage toward the heavenly city, should seek and think of these things which are above. This duty in no way decreases, rather it increases, the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the building of a more human world. Indeed, the mystery of the Christian faith furnishes them with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this duty more courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity, one which gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man.  When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of technology, in order that it might bear fruit and become a dwelling worthy of the whole human family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social groups, he carries out the design of God manifested at the beginning of time, that he should subdue the earth, perfect creation and develop himself. At the same time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself at the service of his brethren.  Furthermore, when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy, history and of mathematical and natural science, and when he cultivates the arts, he can do very much to elevate the human family to a more sublime understanding of truth, goodness, and beauty, and to the formation of considered opinions which have universal value. Thus mankind may be more clearly enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which was with God from all eternity, composing all things with him, rejoicing in the earth, delighting in the sons of men.  In this way, the human spirit, being less subjected to material things, can be more easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator. Moreover, by the impulse of grace, he is disposed to acknowledge the Word of God, Who before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was already \"in the world\" as \"the true light which enlightens every man\" (John 1:9-10).  Indeed today's progress in science and technology can foster a certain exclusive emphasis on observable data, and an agnosticism about everything else. For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth. By virtue of their methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things. Indeed the danger is present that man, confiding too much in the discoveries of today, may think that he is sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher things.  Those unfortunate results, however, do not necessarily follow from the culture of today, nor should they lead us into the temptation of not acknowledging its positive values. Among these values are included: scientific study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries, the necessity of working together with others in technical groups, a sense of international solidarity, a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even to protect men, the desire to make the conditions of life more favorable for all, especially for those who are poor in culture or who are deprived of the opportunity to exercise responsibility. All of these provide some preparation for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which can be animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world.”  Pure science is a tool that humanity can use to gain knowledge of God’s creation. Knowledge of creation sheds light on its Creator and is therefore a commendable exercise for a Christian to undertake. Unfortunately, human history is filled with examples of the knowledge of science being misused for sinful purposes. The use of knowledge is distinct from the knowledge itself, often involving other human enterprises such as medicine, business, politics, etc. Science itself is not free from sin either. When scientists place the pursuit of knowledge above the laws of God, unethical experimentation can result.   Exercise 2: The relationship between faith, science, engineering, and politics     I’d argue that science is an essential part of what makes us human. Do you agree or disagree? Why?    The text above describes two very different ways in which science is misunderstood in society. Explain these two ways in your own words.    How are engineering, science, and politics related?    One of the footnotes above says that scientists can be activists in ethical ways or unethical ways. Do you agree? What requirements would you have for a scientist to behave as an ethical activist?    How can science aid faith? How can faith aid science?    Science can lead to knowledge about the natural world. How is that knowledge connected to our love of God? (Think back to the last lesson)    What are some ethical science problems that you foresee yourself having to contend with in your profession? How might you deal with this?    Academic pursuits (such as you are now undertaking) are full of ethical struggles as you strive to acquire knowledge and progress toward your vocation. In many ways this is similar to the ethical dilemmas encountered by scientists. Come up with 3 ways in which a student might be tempted to sin as they pursue knowledge and advancement.    Christ has conquered sin and has redeemed the world. Use this fact to compose a short prayer that you can use is difficult ethical moments throughout your academic and professional career.     Key:   Exercise 2:    Humans are created to know and wonder. Science is the way in which we can do this in the natural world    Science can be misunderstood to be the “answer to our prayers”. Science can also be distrusted because of how it is utilized for engineering and political purposes. Scientific investigations can also be carried out in unethical ways.    Politics tries to encourage human flourishing. It needs solutions to problems, which is the purpose of engineering. Engineering relies on knowledge from science in order to design good solutions to problems.    An ethical activist\/scientist should not state their theories as scientific fact. They should also present the best synopsis of the available knowledge (and alternative explanations).    Science can remove superstition from faith and correct errors in our knowledge. Faith can allow science to pursue worthwhile knowledge in ethical ways.    Knowledge of nature is knowledge of God’s Creation and thus provides insight into God Himself. It can also provide us the knowledge to better care for our neighbors. In the last lesson we learned that love of neighbor is inseparable from love of God.

  "body": " Chemistry   Summary:     Chemistry    What is the definition of chemistry, matter, and mass?    What is matter and what is energy?       Section 3: Chemistry   Modern science is separated into the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. There is considerable overlap between these subjects since each discipline can influence the others. Chemistry is the study of the properties of matter  Matter is difficult to define exactly. Our definition is that matter must have mass and occupy space. It is essentially the “stuff” that is in the universe. . Matter can be defined as anything that occupies space and has mass  Mass is difficult to define in physics. If something has inertia (the ability to resist changes in movement) or exerts gravitational attraction to other objects, then that object has mass. Mass can be quantified to determine the extent to which an object has inertia or can exhibit gravitational attraction. . Basically, everything that you can see and touch is matter. Even particles that are too small to be seen, such as atoms and molecules, are still matter because they occupy space and have mass. Energy (defined in a later chapter), on the other hand, is NOT matter. It is a property that matter can have, but it is not a thing that occupies space. Light and heat are things that we can experience in the physical world, but they lack mass and thus are not matter. Sound is another example of energy. Sound is caused by the vibration of matter, but it refers to the vibration, not to the particles that are vibrating.  Chemistry is often referred to as the central science. This is because to fully understand the behavior and properties of matter, we first have to understand the laws of physics. Physics provides chemistry with information about the composition of matter and its most basic parts. It also provides chemists with an understanding of energy and how it interacts with matter. At the same time, all organisms are comprised of matter; thus, if we want to understand life, we need to understand the matter that comprises it. Chemistry aids biology by helping us understand how organisms function and can also help us learn how to manipulate biology, for instance by designing pharmaceuticals or pesticides.   Exercise 3: Chemistry, health, and ethics     Write down the definitions of chemistry, matter, and mass.    Are the following best described as matter or energy?    The heat from a fire    The smoke from a fire    The vibration of a string on a violin    A string on a violin      What are your career goals (discuss this with your group)? How might the knowledge of chemistry help you in your career?    Even if you never directly use the knowledge from this course in your profession, does this course still have value to you? Is knowledge without purpose worthless?     Key:   Exercise 3:    See the definitions in the text    Are the following best described as matter or energy?    Energy    Matter    Energy    Matter      Varies    Varies. Knowledge about creation contains knowledge of God. Knowing God is obviously good, so pursuing any knowledge of creation has inherent goodness.    "

In chemistry, they have many uses as we’ll see if upcoming chapters and exercises. The most common math that we do with fractions in chemistry is multiplying and dividing them. To carry out multiplication of fractions, we simply multiply together all of the values in the numerator The numerator is the top of a fraction, keeping the product in the numerator of the final answer, and then do a similar operation with the denominator   Multiplication of fractions example 1:     Multiplication of fractions example 2:     Dividing fractions is similarly quite easy to do. In a division problem, the first number is the dividend and the second is the divisor . Division of fractions can be expressed in multiple ways     Please note that the dividend is the numerator in the fraction expression and the divisor becomes the denominator. To complete this division problem, we simply need to flip the divisor and multiply that value by the dividend.      Section 2: Canceling out factors and labels in calculations   Another VERY important lesson to remember about fractions is that if the numerator and denominator both contain the same factor, then they cancel out. This is true for both numbers in the fractions but also for labels like units. See the examples below:  Example 1: (the 3s cancel out)   Example 2: (the “miles” labels cancel out)      Exercises:    Fraction math.

We have a couple of strategies that make this much more palatable for us. One such strategy is to have different units of measurement for discussing large numbers vs. small numbers. The other common approach is to use scientific notation. Ultimately scientific notation is required, even if we use different units, because we still need to use very large (or small) numbers to express the relationship between these different units. For example, if we are talking about the distance across an atom, a common unit of measurement is an Angstrom. A hydrogen atom has a diameter of approximately 1.1 Angstroms. But how many inches is that? In order to convert between units of Angstroms and inches we'd have to know that 1 Angstrom = 0.00000000394 inches. Working with that number is obviously obnoxious, requiring us to count exactly how many zeroes there are. To get around this, we like to use scientific notation.   a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base   To write a number in scientific notation, we combine a coefficient The coefficient is the leading part of scientific notation. It should always be a number between 1 and 10 and should be written as a decimal. with a base The base follows the coefficient in scientific notation. It is multiplied by the base. It is always 10 raised to some integer power. . The coefficient is always a number that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, and is written as a decimal. The coefficient is then multiplied by the base which is 10 raised to some power.    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    A positive power makes the coefficient larger by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the right by the number of digit places given by the number in the power. Conversely, a negative power makes the coefficient smaller by moving the decimal in the coefficient to the left by the number of digit places given by the number in the power.  We also have to be able to take a number that is written in standard notation and rewrite it in scientific notation. To do this, we move the decimal point in the direction that will result in a coefficient that has a value between 1 and 10. We count the number of digit places that we moved the decimal and that becomes the value in the power. If we moved the decimal to the left, then the power remains positive. If the decimal had to be moved to the right, then the value in the power becomes negative.     a number in scientific notation, identifying coefficient, power, and base    number in scientific notation and moving the decimal point to get expanded form    One of the things that often confuses students about scientific notation is remembering when to move the decimal to the right or the left. These rules can be summed up by remembering the simple rule that big numbers have positive powers and small numbers have negative powers. Remembering this rule can help you determine for yourself whether you should move the decimal right or left.   Exercise 3: Scientific notation     Do the following math problems       Write the following numbers in scientific notation.    3,001.002    5,000,005    10,055,057,001    0.000 057 8    0.08    0.000 000 007 044      Write the following numbers in standard notation.                                      Do the following math problems using your calculator. You probably have a SCI and DEC button or mode on your calculator. If you need help figuring out how to do these on your calculator, please reach out to your instructor or find an online tutorial that is specific to your calculator model.    Write the following numbers in scientific notation.    3,001.002    5,000,005    10,055,057,001    0.000 0578    0.08    0.000 000 007 044      Write the following numbers in standard notation.                                       Section 4: Scientific notation and calculators   Doing multi-step calculations often leads to errors. These errors often result from incorrect calculator usage. It is important to make sure that you are correctly inputting scientific notation into your calculator. Often the correct way to do this is using the EE button on your calculator. If, on the other hand, you input scientific notation using the times button and then your exponent button, you may inadvertently input the incorrect math problem. See the example below:     4.1 EE 3 “divided by” 3.3 EE 10 =   4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 “divided by” 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10  This incorrect input above is actually calculating the following:   Another way that you can correctly input scientific notation is to put parentheses around each of your scientific notation inputs. This allows you to input the scientific notation using whichever method you’d prefer.  ( 4.1 “times” 10 ^ 3 ) “divided by” ( 3.3 “times” 10 ^ 10)  Another important calculator rule to remember is that when we write complex fractions, all of the operations in the numerator and denominator respectively are carried out before the division step. This is correctly input into a calculator by remembering to put parentheses around both the numerator and denominator. See the example below:     ( 7 “plus” 3 ) “divided by” ( 5.5 EE 3 “plus” 100 ) =    Exercise 4: Scientific notation and calculators .

The numbers that we use in our calculations often describe measurements or numbers of things, such as numbers of molecules. This then raises an important consideration for us, namely how precisely do we know the numbers in our calculations? For instance, if I’m measuring the length of a piece of string, do I know its length precisely to the nearest inch, or to the nearest millimeter, or to the nearest nanometer? The answer to that question depends on the tools that were used to make the measurement and their level of precision. Obviously, you won’t be able to tell how many nanometers long a piece of string is by using a typical ruler; another much more expensive measuring device would likely be required.  To understand how precisely we know a quantity, we will first discuss the difference between exact  An exact number is one that is countable, a definition, or a desired quantity. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures. and measured  A measured number is a number that exists because of some measurement. Measured numbers have a finite number of significant figures. numbers. Exact numbers are discrete things that can be counted (ex. 3 eggs), quantities that are exact definitions (ex. there are 12 inches in one foot), or desired values (ex. the established dosage for a pharmaceutical is 10 mg\/kg\/day). Measured numbers are any quantity that had to be measured. They are also found when we are equating units that occur in different systems of measurement (ex. 2.54 cm=1 inch; 1 inch is very close to 2.54 cm, but an inch is not defined as being exactly 2.54 cm).  Exact numbers are known to an infinite level of precision. If you have 3 eggs, you don’t have 3.0000001 eggs…you have exactly 3.00000000… (keeps on going…) eggs. If the dosage of drug that you are supposed to give to a patient is 10mg\/kg\/day, the desired dose is not higher or lower than that…it is exactly that value. Measured numbers, on the other hand, are known only to a certain level of precision. A race may have taken exactly 9.813453223 (feel free to add other random digits on the end) seconds, but if I am using a stop watch that only measures hundredths of a second, then my measured value would be 9.81 seconds. Because of this, measured numbers always have a certain amount of uncertainty associated with them. How then do we communicate the level of certainty with which we know a number?  This brings us to the concept of significant figures  Significant figures are those digits in a number that convey information about its value and its precision. . Significant figures are those digits in a number that reveal the level of precision. We have to worry about the number of significant figures when we’re dealing with measured numbers, since those values are only known to a certain degree of precision. If a stopwatch at the end of a race reads 9.81 seconds, then that measurement has 3 significant figures (the 9, 8, and 1 are each significant). In that case, the time was measured to the hundredths place, but not to the thousandths place and the reported value should reflect that. Exact numbers, on the other hand, have an infinite number of significant figures because of their infinite precision.  In a measured numbers, there are some simple rules to remember in order to identify which digits are significant. First of all, non-zero digits are always significant when the number is written in standard notation (more on scientific notation in just a little bit). The complication comes from zeros in measured numbers.  There are three rules to remember with zeros:    When zeros are to the far left of the number, they are never significant    Zeros in between non-zero digits are always significant    Zeros to the far right of a number are significant ONLY if there is a decimal point written in the number.     Some examples of this:     0.0034 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 1)    3001 (the zeros are significant because of rule 2)    400.0 (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)    300 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)    300. (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3; notice the decimal has been purposely included)    The last rule for significant figures has to deal with scientific notation. In scientific notation, the power and the base are NOT significant. The only significant figures come from the coefficient portion, and it obeys the rules covered previously, including the rules about zeros. So has 5 significant figures (4.0010; the 10 to the 10 th power is not significant). Sometimes we HAVE to write a number in scientific notation to convey the correct number of significant figures. For instance, if you measured as distance of 300 cm to 2 significant figures, you can’t indicate that by writing 300 cm (1 significant figure) or 300. cm (2 significant figures). You can show it by writing cm.

With a digital device, you simply record all of the displayed numbers in your measured number and obey the rules that were learned previously for significant figures in order to determine which digits are significant . For example if a balance reads 0.320 grams, then your measurement is 0.320 grams with 3 significant figures (the left zero is NOT significant because of the rules you learned in the last section).  When we use an analog device, we frequently see that the line that we’re measuring occurs between values on the measuring scale. When reporting these measurements, we report all of the digits that are provided by the measuring scale PLUS we estimate the value of one extra digit by mentally subdividing the scale into 10 equal portions. See the example below:    A graph with a red arrow Description automatically generated   If we’re trying to measure the length of the orange arrow the scale provided depicts tenths of a unit (let’s say it’s centimeters). The orange arrow appears to be between 0.9 and 1 cm long. Since this is an analog scale, we should ALWAYS estimate one extra significant digit, even if that digit is a 0. In this case, my estimate would be 0.94 cm, but yours might differ slightly (though it should be 0.9 something).    A line with numbers and a line with a line AI-generated content may be incorrect.   In this case not all of the digits in the tenths place are shown, only 0.5. Because of this we don’t estimate an extra decimal place. Instead we estimate for the decimal place shown by the most precise markings, in this case the tenths place. My estimate would be 0.9 cm. Your estimate might be 0.8 cm or even 1.0 cm.   Exercise 2: Digital vs. analog measurements      Record the proper measurement with the following devices (don’t worry about the units). How many significant figures are in each measurement?                             "

  "body": " Basics of Matter   Summary:     How matter is classified    Mixtures vs. pure substances    Homogenous vs. heterogeneous mixtures      Relationship between elements and compounds    Idea of an atom    Law of constant composition      States of matter    Properties of solids, liquids, and gases    Odd-ball cases       Section 1: Classification of matter   There are different ways to classify matter, but this diagram is one that that can help you compartmentalize your knowledge throughout the course. The diagram strives to classify matter according to its complexity and arrangement. This sort of classification has historical importance to chemistry because it what allowed scientists to begin to gain an understanding of what matter is made of. For instance, it is essential to know what an element is in order to understand that a compound is made up of elements.  The highest classes of matter on the chart are mixtures  Matter that consists of multiple pure substances. The pure substances can be separated by physical processes. and pure substances  Matter that cannot be separated into different components by physical processes. . The difference between these terms is that mixtures consist of multiple substances, while pure substances are only one. The difference between these can be obvious, but that isn’t always the case. For instance, you can clearly see that a glass of sand and water contains multiple substances because we can see the sand and the water and they clearly appear to be different. In the case of salt water, it would be difficult to determine whether it’s a mixture of substances (water and salt) by simply looking at it. Sugar, is a pure substance, but brass is not…so how do we know that something is a pure substance or a mixture?  This is not as straightforward as it might initially seem, but we can come up with rules to help us out. A mixture contains two different substances AND those substances can be separated by physical processes  Physical processes are ones that don’t change the identity of a substance. . A physical process is a one that doesn’t need other substances to be added. Also a physical process will preserve the identity and characteristics of each of the components. Easy examples are boiling and freezing a liquid. The identity of that liquid is the same if it’s a solid, liquid, or gas despite it having somewhat different characteristics. Other examples of physical processes include filtering, cutting, sorting, etc. Sand and water can be separated by filtration, a physical process, and therefore sandy water is classified as a mixture. In the example of salt water we know that it is a mixture because we can separate it into its components (salt and water) by boiling the water and taking advantage of the fact that salt and water have different physical properties  Physical properties are properties of a material that can be discovered while preserving the identity of the substance . A physical property is a property (like boiling point, freezing point, size, color, etc.) that can be observed without altering the chemical identity of a substance.  Within the category of mixtures, we have homogenous mixtures  Homogeneous mixtures consist of two or more pure substances that are mixed in a uniform manner. and heterogenous mixtures  Heterogeneous mixtures consist of two or more pure substances that are mixed in a non-uniform manner . The difference between these terms deals with the arrangement of the components. If the components are evenly distributed throughout the mixture, then we have a homogeneous mixture. If the arrangement is not uniform, then it’s a heterogeneous mixture. Heterogeneous mixtures are sometimes obvious, like sand in water; if you let it sit for a little while the sand settles to the bottom. Sometimes heterogeneous mixtures are not immediately identifiable as such. Consider blood; it initially looks like a uniform red liquid. However, if you let it sit for a little while, the cells in the blood will soon settle to the bottom of the container, similar to sand in water.  In a homogeneous mixture, the various substances are evenly distributed, even at a microscopic level. Because of this, you will not see the various particles that make up a homogeneous mixture. Solutions  A homogeneous mixture where one pure substance is dissolved into another are homogeneous mixtures where one substance (the solute  The lesser component of a solution is called the solute ) is dissolved in a larger amount of the second substance (the solvent  The major component of a solution is called the solvent ). The solvent and the solute can be the same state of matter or different states. For instance, oxygen gas can be dissolved in water, forming a solution. Salt can also be dissolved in water. Gases can be dissolved in one another (for example, air is a solution where small amounts of oxygen gas, carbon dioxide, etc. are dissolved in the solvent of nitrogen gas). There are also solutions made of metals, and these are called alloys  Homogeneous mixtures of metals are called alloys . Bronze is a mixture of zinc and copper where the two substances have so fully dispersed that the mixture is now uniform. Homogenous mixtures can still be separated by physical processes, but they often require more effort (ex. many heterogeneous mixtures can be separated by filtration, whereas a homogenous mixture may require boiling, condensing, or melting).  Pure substances, on the other hand, cannot be separated by physical processes. If you boil pure liquid water, it will be entirely converted into water vapor. If you condense the water vapor it will entirely turn back into liquid water. In both cases, there isn’t any substance that is separated from the water or water vapor by carrying out these physical processes; the substance remains unchanged. Physical processes cannot change the composition of a pure substance. The discovery of pure substances and their further classification into elements and compounds was essential to our understanding of the composition of the world around us. This will be further explored in the next section.   Exercise 1: Classification of matter     Identify the following as being a mixture or pure substance    Soda    Wood    Air    Oxygen gas    Iron    Table salt    A DNA molecule      Identify the following mixtures as homogeneous or heterogeneous    Wood    Soda    Steel    Bronze    Granite    Fog      Which of the following properties are physical properties?    A piece of wood can be cut in half    That apple is red    1 gram of sugar can be dissolved into a liter of water    Sugar can be set on fire    An iron fence rusts when exposed to water    Lead can be removed from water by filtration    A plate is brittle       Section 2: Relationship between elements and compounds   Pure substances can be subdivided into elements  Elements are pure substances that cannot be broken down further by chemical processes and compounds  Compounds are pure substances that consist of two or more elements. They can only be separated into their component elements by chemical processes. . The distinction between elements and compounds depends on whether they can be broken down into simpler units by chemical processes  A chemical process is a reaction that changes the identity of a substance . A chemical process is a reaction that often (but not always) involves the addition of one or more additional reactants and always results in the chemical identity of the starting substance changing. Chemical processes may result in a significant change in the appearance of the starting substance or evolution of a gas, but in other cases there may be little obvious indication that a reaction has occurred (that’s a subject that is covered in other classes like organic chemistry in much more detail). If a pure substance can be broken down into simpler units by a chemical process, then we’re dealing with a compound. If it can’t, then we’re dealing with an element.  We now know of the existence of over 100 different elements. Each element can be found arranged in the periodic table  An organized table that displays the elements and additional information about each one. (more about the periodic table in a later chapter). If you can find a substance in the periodic table, then it’s an element. The cells in the periodic table contain information about each element. For right now, we’ll focus on the name each element as well as its element symbol  An abbreviation for an element consisting of one or more letters , a short abbreviation that is used to represent that element (example: H is the element symbol for hydrogen). Many of these element symbols make sense with the English name of the element. Other element symbols are derived from the Latin name of the element (example: sodium is called natrium in Latin and its symbol is Na).  What then is the relationship between an element and a compound. This relationship was one of the key discoveries in chemistry, and its discovery opened up our understanding of the foundational composition of all matter. One of these early insights came from the discovery of the Law of constant composition  The law of constant composition states that the ratio of elements in a compound is always a constant . This law states that compounds always have the same ratio of elements. For instance, water always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 8 grams of oxygen. Methane, another compound, always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 3 grams of carbon. This discovery showed scientists that compounds were comprised of elements in very specific ratios.  The next key discovery came from comparing the ratios of elements in one compound to the ratios found in other compounds where both compounds consisted of the same elements. For instance, methane has a 1:3 ratio between the mass of hydrogen and the mass of carbon as stated in the previous paragraph. Ethane is another compound made of carbon and hydrogen, but the ratio between hydrogen and carbon is 1:4. If we divide these two ratios we get a ratio of 4:3, meaning that ethane contains 4\/3 as much carbon as methane. This can be done for many other pairs of compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. If we do this, we get other ratios like 1:2, 1:3, or 3:2. In every case, we begin to see that when we divide the ratios of carbon and hydrogen between two compounds, we always get ratios of integers ! This is known as the Law of multiple proportions  The law of multiple proportions states that if you divide the ratios of elements for two different compounds that contain the same elements, you will always get a ratio of integers . The realization that there are integer relationships between the composition of different compounds means that the carbon and hydrogen in these compounds occurs in discrete countable units . These discrete countable units are called atoms  The smallest unit of an element. .  Thanks to the Law of constant composition and the law of multiple proportions, we now know that all compounds are comprised of atoms of various elements that are combined together a specific ratio. This ratio can be written as a chemical formula  A way of showing how many atoms of a given element make up a single unit of a chemical compound . The formula for a compound is written by listing the element symbol followed by a subscript number indicating the number of atoms of that element that comprise the compound’s formula unit (please note, that if there is only one atom of a particular type that the number 1 is NOT written). So Na 2 SO 4 has 2 sodium atoms, one sulfur atom, and 4 oxygen atoms in every unit of that compound.   Exercise 2: Relationship between elements and compounds     Explain the Law of constant composition in your own words.    Identify the following as elements or compounds    Sugar    DNA    Gold    Antimony    NaF    CCl 4       What is the ratio of chlorine to carbon in CCl 4 ? How many of each type of atom are in this compound?    What is the ratio of carbon to chlorine in C 2 Cl 6 ? How many of each atom type are in this compound?    Divide the ratios of chlorine to carbon that you got in problems 3 and 4. What ratio do you get? Is this consistent with the Law of multiple proportions? Explain.    Look up the formula for sucrose (table sugar). Do the same for insulin (a peptide hormone)? How many of each type of atom are in these molecules?     Section 3: States of matter   The states of matter  Three different forms that matter can adopt while preserving its identity. The states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. are solids, liquids, and gases. When a substance undergoes a change in its state, it still retains its same chemical identity, and thus state changes are reversible. Water still has its same chemical formula and identity regardless of whether it is ice, liquid water, or water vapor. Each of these states has different properties, but they are properties of that state, not of water itself.  The properties that define a solid  A state of matter that has a fixed shape and a fixed volume are that it has a fixed shape and volume. Solids do not flow. They can change shape but require some outside force to cause this to happen (like bending a nail with a hammer). On a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the particles that make up the solid are held together by forces that are so strong that the particles can’t move past one another. As a result, the arrangement of the particles is fixed, and the shape of the substance as a whole remains fixed.   Liquids  A state of matter that can flow and has a fixed volume but a variable shape. It will take on the shape of its container , on the other hand, have a fixed volume, but not a fixed shape. They will take on the shape of their container. Liquids can flow and move in response to gravity. On a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the attractive forces between the particles are strong enough to maintain contact between the particles but weak enough that the particles can move past one another. As a result, the entire liquid is capable of movement and flow. At the same time, the attraction between the particles ensures that they never fully separate, so the volume remains fixed regardless of the shape.   Gases  A state of matter that has a variable shape and volume. A gas will take on the shape and volume of its container have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. A gas will always fill up the entirety of the container that it is placed in. Gases can flow like liquids, but their component particles have enough energy that they can flow in all directions, completely filling up their container. The microscopic reason for these properties is that the particles in a gas are moving so rapidly past one another that they don’t interact at all (in actuality, there are very small interactions between gas particles, but chemists often ignore this). As a result a gas will always spread out to occupy the entirety of its container, meaning that a gas will not have a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.  The reason for the differences between the states of matter is that the particles that make them up have different amounts of kinetic energy  Energy of motion . Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is affected by both the mass of an object and its velocity (ex. a baseball thrown by a toddler will hurt a lot less than by one thrown by a professional pitcher due to the difference in velocity and hence the difference in kinetic energy). The particles in a gas are moving much faster than those in a liquid; the particles in a liquid are moving much faster than those in a solid. Because of this, we can conclude that the particles in a gas have more kinetic energy than those in a liquid and that those in a liquid have more have more kinetic energy than those in a solid. So in order to turn a solid into a liquid ( melting  The process of converting a substance from a solid to a liquid ), we have to add energy to the substance by heating it. The same is true for turning a liquid into a gas ( boiling  The process of converting a substance from a liquid to a gas. or vaporizing  Same as boiling ). If we want to turn a gas into a liquid ( condensing  The process of converting a gas into a liquid ) we have to remove kinetic energy from the substance by cooling it. The same is true for freezing  The process of converting a liquid into a solid a substance (the process of turning a liquid into a solid).   Exercise 3: States of matter     If kinetic energy is added to water, it will eventually turn into a ________ (solid\/gas). Select one.    Sometimes substances can resemble multiple states of matter (ex. jello). What properties of jello resemble solid? Which ones are like a liquid?    Even some substances that appear to be solid can have properties of other states. Some people would argue that glass is actually a liquid. Skim the following article and explain what properties glass has that makes people think it’s a liquid and why it has this strange behavior. Article link: https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/chemistry\/is-glass-a-liquid-or-a-solid         Key:   Exercise 1:      Mixture    Mixture    Mixture    Pure substance    Pure substance    Pure substance    Pure substance        Heterogeneous    Homogeneous    Homogeneous    Homogeneous    Heterogeneous    Heterogeneous      J    Physical    Physical    Physical    Not physical (chemical)    Not physical (chemical)    Physical    Physical      Exercise 2:    Every chemical compound consists of a particular and unvarying ratio of different atoms    J    Compound    Compound    Element    Element    Compound    Compound      4:1 ratio, 4 chlorines, 1 carbon    3:1 ratio (or 6:2), 6 chlorines, 2 carbons    4:3 or 3:4 Yes. Both of these are ratios of integers    12 carbons, 22 hydrogens, 11 oxygens (sucrose)    256 carbons, 381 hydrogens, 65 nitrogens, 77 oxygens, and 6 sulfurs (insulin)  Exercise 3:    Gas    Solid: fixed volume; fixed shape (if it doesn’t move) Liquid: shape isn’t fixed; slowly flows to take the shape of its container    Bottom of old glass can be bulged; this gives the impression that the glass flows down over time; glass does flow, but not that fast; flow of glass is due to disordered molecular structure that makes it easier for parts to flow past one another    "

  "title": "Basics of Energy",
  "body": " Basics of Energy    Summary:     Energy, heat, and temperature    What is meant by all 3 terms    Converting between different units of energy    Converting between different units of temperature      Energy in food    Calculating how many Calories are in a serving of food      Light and electromagnetic radiation    Wavelength and frequency    Energy    Relative position of types of light on the electromagnetic spectrum       Section 1: Energy, heat and temperature   You just learned about kinetic energy, but was is energy itself? In order to understand energy, we must first define work  Applying a force to an object over some distance . Work is when a force is applied to an object over some distance. Energy  The capacity of an object to do work or produce heat or light is a property of an object or substance that describes its ability to do work, or to produce light or heat. Energy is a very important consideration in chemistry. It influences the properties of matter, including its state and temperature. Additionally, energy may be released or consumed by reactions. All reactions require energy input to occur, and some require so much energy that they won’t occur unless the reaction is heated or there is a spark (ex. a mixture of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas will not react with one another unless the reaction is provided with a flame or spark to get it going).  Energy can be subdivided into two classes: kinetic energy  Energy of motion and potential energy  Stored energy . Kinetic energy is energy of motion or vibration. Potential energy is stored energy that could potentially be converted into kinetic energy. A classic physics example is that a boulder sitting on a small hill has a small amount of potential energy compared to the same boulder sitting on top of a mountain. Due to the height difference, the boulder would speed up more if it were pushed off the mountain than a small hill. Once the boulder is pushed, the potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy. In chemistry, we’re not usually thinking about boulders rolling down hills. Instead, energy is stored in the form of bonds  Forces that hold atoms or molecules together that join atoms and molecules together. When this energy is released, the motion of the atoms or molecules increases.  The movement of atoms and molecules, including rotations and vibrations, is chemical kinetic energy. When we measure temperature  Quantification of the amount of kinetic energy contained in the molecules of an object what we are measuring is the amount of chemical kinetic energy in a substance. As energy is added to a substance, the temperature generally increases, and this is due to increased motion of the particles that make it up.  Both energy and temperature are quantifiable in chemistry. The SI units of energy are joules. In this course, due to its focus on health sciences, we will more commonly use the unit of calorie (1 calorie = 4.184 joules). The unit calories (abbreviate cal) can use the metric prefixes that you’ve previously learned with the most commonly version being a kilocalorie, or kcal. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy that will raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. When we’re dealing with the energy content of food, we often use units of Calories (note that it is now capitalized). 1 Calorie is equivalent to 1kcal or 1000 calories.  For temperature, we have 2 units that are commonly used by society (Fahrenheit and Celsius) and another that is used extensively in science (Kelvin). Fahrenheit is related to Celsius by the following formula:     In this formula, the 1.8 and 32 are EXACT numbers. Kelvin is a temperature scale that has its zero point at absolute zero (ie. the coldest possible temperature where there is no motion). To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, we use the following formula:     Kelvin will always have a positive value, and for this reason, it often must be used as the unit of temperature in scientific formulas. Using these two formulae, we can easily convert between different temperature units by using some algebra skills:  Example: Express the temperature in Celsius and Kelvin.    We have a formula to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius and another formula to go from Celsius to Kelvin. Let’s determine Celsius first, then Kelvin.    Let’s plug in the temperature in Fahrenheit and then rearrange the equation to solve for Celsius:           (Subtract 32 from both sides)      (Divide both sides by 1.8)   (Round to correct number of significant figures)       Now take the temperature in Celsius and plug it into the formula to solve for Kelvin:           (Round to the correct number of significant figures)     With 3 different temperature scales, it’s important to have an idea of how hot values are in each of them. You should know the following values in each unit of temperature:          Reference point  Fahrenheit  Celsius  Kelvin    Freezing point of water  32  0  273.15    Body temperature  ~98.6  ~37  ~310    Boiling point of water  212  100  373.15      Exercise 1: Energy, heat and Temperature     Do the following conversions:    17.4 J = ? kJ    16.3 J= ? cal    16.3 J= ?

Kelvin      If an object with a mass of 32kg has 72 kJ of potential energy and 65 kJ is converted into kinetic energy, how much potential energy does the object still have?    Which of the following temperatures corresponds to a patient with a fever?    37 degrees C    40 degrees C    98 degrees C    25 degrees C      Which of the following represents kinetic energy vs. potential energy?    A chemical bond linking two atoms    An atom vibrating    A molecule rotating    A person standing at the top of a staircase    A rock rolling down a hill    A car driving    The fuel in the gas tank of a car       Section 2: Food energy   When we buy food at the grocery store, it has the amount of energy that our bodies can obtain from digestion printed on the label in the form of Calories (note: that it is capitalized). This value is obtained by calculating the amount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the food. Carbohydrates and proteins both contain 4 Calories of energy for every gram. Fats, on the other hand, have more energy, containing 9 Calories in every gram (consider the 4 and 9 to be exact numbers, even though they are technically measured). If we know how many grams of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat are in a serving of food, we can calculate how many Calories it contains. See the example below:  A serving of food contains 3.0 g of carbohydrates, 5.0 g of fat, and 17 g of protein. How many Calories are in a serving?    We want to determine how many Calories come from each class of biomolecule and then add those values together to get the total.    We need to use dimensional analysis:    Carbohydrates:     Fat:     Protein:       Then add:        Exercise 2: Food energy     A serving of food has 10.0g protein, 25g carbohydrates, and 3.0 grams of fat per serving. How many Calories are in that serving? How many calories are in that serving?    A serving of food contains 17 g of fat and 45 g of carbohydrates. Are most of the Calories in that serving due to fat or carbohydrates? Explain.    A soda contains 38 g of carbohydrates per serving. A single bottle of soda contains 2.5 servings. If you consume 3 bottles of soda in a day, how many Calories are you ingesting?     Section 3: Electromagnetic radiation   When we are talking about energy in chemistry, one common way in which energy can be released or taken up by matter is in the form of electromagnetic radiation  A form of energy that can travel through space as a wave of electrical and magnetic fields . Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that can travel through space as both a wave and a particle called a photon  A massless particle of electromagnetic radiation. They are the smallest unit of electromagnetic radiation. . We all experience electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is one form of electromagnetic radiation. However, even blind people are able to experience non-visible forms of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared rays (think about how light from the sun makes things hot…a lot of this is due to infrared radiation). There are several different forms of electromagnetic radiation: gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves.  Electromagnetic radiation exists as a wave. Waves can be depicted graphically as shown below. Note the definition of a wavelength  The distance between two identical points of a wave. depicted in the drawing below. A wavelength is the distance between two identical points on different parts of the same wave. The list of forms of electromagnetic radiation listed in the paragraph above (gamma rays, x-rays, UV rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves) are arranged in order of increasing wavelengths. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths (meters or even kilometers long) and gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths (<0.01 nanometers).      The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is related to two other properties: energy and frequency  The number of waves that pass a certain point in a specific amount of time (usually 1 second) . The shorter the wavelength, the more energy that the electromagnetic radiation has. You can try to understand this by thinking about trying to vibrate a stretched out spring…you don’t have to use much energy to get the spring to vibrate slowly (long wavelengths), but you have to expend a lot of energy to get the spring to vibrate quickly (short wavelengths). An in-class demonstration can be helpful here. Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a certain point every second. Electromagnetic radiation, regardless of the type, travels with the same speed (known as the speed of light). If the waves are spaced close together, then more waves will pass by every second compared to a case where the waves are further apart. As a result, light with a long wavelength will have low frequencies. The exercises below will help you to visualize this.   Exercise 3: Electromagnetic radiation     Draw a wave with 5 wavelengths    Draw another wave with 5 shorter wavelengths and another with 5 longer wavelengths on the same sheet of paper, draw them one above the other in a stack of sorts    Hold a pencil or pen above them as a line of reference and drag your paper underneath. Which wave that you drew has waves pass the line provided by the pen\/pencil fastest.    Do longer wavelengths or shorter wavelengths of light have greater frequencies?      If light has a wavelength of 22 cm, how many meters is the wavelength?    What forms of electromagnetic radiation have energies greater than visible light? Less than visible light?    What forms of electromagnetic radiation have wavelengths longer than visible light? Shorter than visible light? Longer than microwaves? Shorter than x-rays?    What forms of electromagnetic radiation have frequencies greater than UV rays? Lower than infrared rays?

  "body": " Changes in Temperature and\/or State   Summary:     Heating and cooling    How to do calculations involving heating or cooling a substance when it does NOT change state    Uses specific heat      State changes    How to do calculations involving heating or cooling a substance when it is undergoing a change in state    Uses heat of fusion or heat of vaporization      Multistep calculations    How to do multistep calculations involving heating or cooling a substance that involve changes in state and temperature    These calculations are simply the other two types added together       Section 1: Heating and cooling   We all know that if you heat up ice it will melt. If you heat water, it will warm up and eventually will start to boil. As chemists, we can predict how much energy is needed for each of these processes. We can also predict what the effect of adding a certain amount of energy to a substance will have on its state and temperature.  When we add or remove energy from an object, this is called heat  The transfer of energy between two different objects . Addition of heat to an object causes the temperature to rise whereas the movement of heat from an object to its surroundings causes its temperature to fall. Our convention for specifying whether or not heat is moving into or from an object is to change the sign on the heat value. A negative heat value implies that the object is losing energy to its surroundings whereas a positive value indicates that heat is being transferred into the object. I like to think of the object of interest as being selfish and lazy. If heat is added, then the object is happy (plus sign) because it’s gaining. Conversely, if the object is losing heat, then that’s a negative experience as far as the object is concerned.  We can predict the relationship between the amount of heat added or removed and a corresponding temperature change by using a quantity known as specific heat  The amount of heat needed to raise 1 g of a substance by 1 degree Kelvin (or Celsius) . The specific heat of a substance is a constant that describes how much heat is required to cause a temperature change of 1 degree Kelvin to 1 g of that substance. You’ve already encountered the specific heat of water when we learned about calories (remember that 1.00 calories is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1 degree Celsius or Kelvin). Specific heat values differ between materials and also between different states of matter (ice, water, and water vapor each have different specific heat values).  Specific heat has units of . We can use specific heat as a conversion factor in calculations. We can use specific heat to calculate the amount of heat added or removed from an object if we are given the mass and temperature change. Alternatively, we can predict a temperature change if we are given the mass and amount of heat added or removed. We can also calculate the specific heat of a substance if we are given the heat, mass, and temperature change. See the examples below:  Substance E has a specific heat of 4.03 cal\/(g K). If 25 g of substance E begins at a temperature of 42.0 degrees C and 403 calories of heat is added, what will its new temperature be?    What are we being asked for: We’re asked to find the final temperature. The specific heat can be used to determine the temperature change.    Find the path: The specific heat has units of temperature in it, but also mass (grams) and heat (cal) that need to be eliminated. We’re provided the mass in grams and the heat in cal and should be able to use those values to cancel out all of the unwanted units.    Calculate:    Temperature change:   Remember that Kelvin and Celsius degrees have the same magnitude (ie. an increase of 1 degree Celsius is the same as an increase of 1 degree Kelvin) so the increase is also 4.0 degrees Celsius  New temperature: 42.0 degrees C + 4.0 degrees C = 46.0 degrees C   Exercise 1: Heating and cooling     Write a formula to calculate specific heat that includes heat (abbreviated q), mass (m), and temperature change ( ). Pay attention to the units on specific heat to guide you. If needed, how would you calculate the change in temperature? Write a version of the equation that includes the starting and ending temperatures (T 1 and T 2 ) instead of the change in temperature.    Determine the specific heat of an object if 35 cal of heat causes 22 g of the substance to increase in temperature by 4 degrees Kelvin.    Determine the specific heat of an object if 35 cal of heat causes 22 g of the substance to increase in temperature from 50.0 K to 52.1 K.    Substance X has a specific heat of 2.3 cal\/(g K). If 5.0 g of substance X receives 87 cal of heat, what is the temperature change?    Substance Y has a specific heat of 1.7 cal\/(g K). If 5.0 g of substance Y receives 87 cal of heat, what is the temperature change? Compare your answers in questions 4 and 5. Does a smaller specific heat result in a bigger or smaller temperature change when the same amount of heat is applied?    How many Calories must be removed from water to cool 17kg of it from 40.0 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees Celsius? (This is basically the same as cooling a small child who has a fever)    A 40.0g block of metal with a specific heat of 0.75 cal\/(g K) and a temperature of 75 degrees Celsius is put into 200.0 g of water at 25 degrees Celsius. What will the final temperature of the water and metal be? How much heat was transferred from the metal to the water?    The same amount of heat was added to the water as was lost by the metal. Start with your equation for specific heat and rearrange it so that you have heat= something    You have two of these equations, one for the water and one for the metal. Set them equal to one another since the heat transferred was the same (but make sure to add a negative sign to the side that corresponds to the metal, because it lost heat).    Plug in your values for the starting temperatures and specific heats and solve for the end temperature    Use the equation you made in part a to solve for the heat transferred      A 40.0g block of metal with a temperature of 75 degrees Celsius is put into 200.0 g of water at 25 degrees Celsius. The final temperature of the water and the metal is 70. degrees Celsius. What is the specific heat of the metal?    Use a similar procedure to the last problem. This time you have different information and a different unknown. Plug your values in and solve for the specific heat of the metal       Section 2: State changes   When a substance is undergoing a change in state (ex. liquid to gas) heat input or removal is often required. However, during the process of the state change, the temperature of the substance doesn’t change . For example, when ice is melting, it remains at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius until the solid has been fully converted into liquid. Once this happens, further heating will result in a temperature increase. Since there is no change in temperature involved in a state change, we need a different constant to predict how much heat will be required for these processes. For melting and for freezing, we use a constant called the heat of fusion  The amount of energy that is needed to melt 1 g of a solid into a liquid . It tells us how much energy input (or release) is required to melt (or freeze) 1 g of a substance. For changes from liquid to gas (or vice-versa) a similar constant is used that is called the heat of vaporization  The amount of energy that is needed to boil 1 g of a liquid into a gas . For changes from a solid directly to a gas (or vice-versa) a constant called the heat of sublimation  The amount of energy that is needed to sublimate 1g of a solid into a gas can be used.        The heat of fusion of water is 80. cal\/g. A hamburger contains 600. Calories. How many grams of ice could be melted at 0 degrees Celsius using the energy contained in the hamburger?    What we’re being asked for: We want the number of grams of ice that could be melted. There is a g unit in the heat of fusion; we just need to get rid of cal.    See the path: We need to get rid of cal in the heat of fusion, but we only have the 600 Calories (capitalized). If we turn the Calories into calories, then they can cancel out the units in the heat of fusion, leaving us grams.    Calculate:        Exercise 2: State changes     Come up with a formula for heat of fusion (H fusion ) that has the terms heat (q) and mass (m) in it. Would you expect the formulae for heat of vaporization and heat of sublimation to be the same or different…explain.    How much energy is needed to vaporize 23 g of water at 100. degrees Celsius? Assume that the heat of vaporization of water is 539 cal\/g.    72 cal is enough energy to melt _________g of ice at 0 degrees Celsius. Assume the heat of fusion is 80. cal\/g    Removing 72 cal from water at 0 degrees C is sufficient to freeze _________g of water into ice. Solve this one without a calculator using previous results from this exercise.     Consider the following diagram. Which portions of the graph correspond to melting and which parts correspond to boiling?     Consider the following cooling curve. Which letter represents the cooling of liquid water? Which letter(s) represent parts of the curve where liquid water is present?     Section 3: Multistep problems   Using the knowledge and skills that you practiced above we can now set about solving multistep problems that involve state changes and temperature changes. The key things to remember is that we are simply going to use the methods we’ve already learned. In order to do this, we need to treat each section of a multistep problem as its own calculation. For instance, if heat is being added to ice that is at -20 degrees C, resulting in the ice melting and becoming water at 50 degrees C, then we have to consider the following steps:    The warming of the ice to 0 degrees C    The melting of the ice at 0 degrees C    The warming of the water to 50 degrees C    42 g of ice at -20. degrees C is warmed up until it completely boils away at 100. degrees C. How much energy was added to the water throughout this process.    What are we being asked for: Find the heat for the entire process.    Find the path: We need the sum of the heats from each of the individual steps. The steps are:    Heating the ice from -20 degrees to 0 degrees C    Melting the ice at 0 degrees C    Warming the water from 0 to 100 degrees C    Boiling the water at 100 degrees C      Steps a and c are temperature increases and will use the specific heat of ice and water respectively. Steps b and d are melting and boiling and will use the heat of fusion and heat of vaporization of water respectively.

  "body": " Atoms and the Periodic Table   Summary:     Atoms and subatomic particles    Mass, charge, and location of protons, neutrons, and electrons      Atomic number and mass number    What is the meaning of these numbers    Using these numbers and the charge to determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an atom      Periodic table    How is it arranged?    Groups vs. periods    Information in a square    Information from the location of an element in the periodic table       Sections 1: Atoms and subatomic particles   All chemicals are made up of elements that are combined together. The smallest unit of an element that possesses the properties of that element is called an atom  The smallest unit of an element. . Atoms are incredibly small with sizes of approximately 0.1 nm. Numerous discoveries in physics and chemistry in the late 1800s and early 1900s revealed to scientists that there are smaller components that make up atoms which are called subatomic particles  Particles that make up an atom . The first particle to be discovered was the electron  A negatively charged particle found in the electron cloud of an atom. They have mass, but their mass is often rounded to 0 amu. . Scientists showed that electrons could be moved by electric fields, and this property was called charge. The charge of an electron was assigned a value of -1, with the understanding that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. Electrons were also found to have mass, but only a tiny percentage of the mass of an atom. Because of this, the mass of an electron is often rounded to 0 atomic mass units (amu)  Atomic mass units are units of mass that are used for very small masses like the mass of an atom. . Other important observations about electrons were that electrons could be deflected by atoms, implying that the outer part of atoms has a negative charge. This, coupled with the observation that electrons could be removed from atoms relatively easily, lead to our current understanding that electrons exist on the outside of atoms.  The next particle to be discovered were protons  Positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of approximately 1 amu. . Scientists learned that protons had considerably more mass than electrons and were assigned a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (atomic mass units are a relative scale of masses that are used primarily to describe the mass of subatomic particles). Additionally, protons were shown to have a charge of +1. Protons thus attract electrons and help to hold electrons in atoms. Additionally, it was revealed that when atoms are bombarded with positively charged particles similar to protons, that they often just passed through the atom and were only occasionally deflected. This was very different behavior than was observed for electrons. This lead to the understanding that protons occur in a small part of the atom near its center, called the nucleus  The small dense collection of protons and neutrons that is found at the center of an atom . Later experiments showed that the nucleus of an atom has protons and another subatomic particle called a neutron  An uncharged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of approximately 1 amu. . Neutrons have similar masses as protons (approximately 1 amu) but do not have any charge.   Exercise 1: Atoms and subatomic particles     Is most of the mass of the atom found in the nucleus or the electron cloud that surrounds it?    If an atom had 17 protons, 17 electrons, and 10 neutrons…    What would the mass of the atom be    How many positively charged particles are in the atom?    How many negatively charged particles are in the atom?    What is the sum of the positive and negative charges in the atom (ie. what is the net charge of the atom)?    Answer a-d for an atom with 35 protons, 34 electrons and 36 neutrons.      If the number of electrons in an atom is greater than the number of protons, then the atom will have a net ____________(positive\/negative) charge.    If an atom has a mass of 17 and contains 8 protons, how many electrons would be present if the net charge on the atom is -2?     Section 2: Atomic number and mass number   To describe the number of subatomic particles in an atom, chemists use two different numbers, atomic number and mass number. Atomic number  The number of protons in an atom. is ALWAYS equal to the number of protons in an atom. If the atom has a net charge of zero, then the atomic number will also be equal to the number of electrons. Every atom of a given element will ALWAYS have the same atomic number. The atomic number is also unique for each atom; no two elements have the same atomic number. Thus different elements can be distinguished by their number of protons.  The mass number  The sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Since protons and neutrons both have masses of approximately 1 amu, and electrons have masses of approximately 0 amu, only the protons and neutrons are counted for the mass number. For a given element, every atom will have the same number of protons, as stated in the paragraph above. However, atoms of the same element may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that have different masses (and thus different numbers of neutrons) are called isotopes  Atoms of an element that have different mass numbers . Isotopes are important in chemistry and physics not just because they have different masses, but because they may have different properties. For instance, some isotopes of an element may be stable while others may undergo radioactive decay (Chapter 5). Isotopes are often specified in one of three ways:    By writing the element name followed by a hyphen and then the mass number (ex. carbon-14)    By writing the mass number as a superscript prior to the element symbol (ex. 14 C).    By writing the mass number as a superscript prior to the element symbol along with the atomic number as a subscript prior to the element symbol (ex. )     Exercise 2: Atomic number and mass number     Come up with a formula to calculate the mass number (abbreviated A) from the number of protons and the number of neutrons    Modify your formula to calculate the mass number (A) from the atomic number (abbreviated Z) and the number of neutrons    Rearrange your equation from part a above to solve for the number of neutrons if you are given the mass number and atomic number      Why aren’t electrons counted when calculating the mass number of an isotope?    If an atom has an atomic number of 17 and a mass number of 35, how many neutrons are in the atom?    If the atom is neutral, how many electrons are in the atom?    If the atom has a charge of +3, how many electrons are in the atom?      If an atom has 32 protons, 33 electrons, and 42 neutrons, what is its mass number and charge?    What is the atomic number of an atom that contains 47 protons and 45 electrons?    An isotope with 42 neutrons and a charge of +3 has a mass number of 102. How many electron and protons are in the atom?     Section 3: Periodic table of elements   Since each atom has its own atomic number, we can arrange the elements in order of increasing atomic number. If this is done AND atoms with similar reactivity properties are placed in the same column, then the result is the modern periodic table. The periodic table was first introduced by Dmitri Mendeleev in the mid 1800s. He arranged elements by increasing mass (rather than by atomic number) and also strove to group elements with similar reactivities (similar to our current periodic table). One of the most impressive findings of his initial periodic table was that is predicted the existence of elements that were not yet known to chemists, but that are known now. Additionally, the position of elements within the periodic table allows scientists to predict how atoms will behave in certain reactions. Finally, the periodic table was useful in showing that there are patterns that predict when certain reactivity properties will occur. This pattern would later prove valuable in helping chemists understand the subatomic structural details of atoms and how it relates to reactivity (more on this in later chapters).  The periodic table contains information about every known element in squares throughout the table. The number at the top of the square is the atomic number of the element. The element name and element symbol are often given below the atomic number. In many cases, the element symbol is similar to the element name in English. In other cases, the element symbol reflects the Latin name of the element (ex. Iron’s symbol is Fe, reflecting the name ferrum in Latin). Below the element symbol is another number called the atomic mass, which will be covered in the next section. It is important to be able to distinguish between the atomic mass of an element and the mass number of an isotope.  The elements within the periodic table are organized into rows and columns. The rows are called periods  Rows in the periodic table and the columns are called groups  Columns in the periodic table. Elements in the same group usually have similar chemical and physical properties. . The periods and numbers are assigned numbers. The groups in the periodic table are numbered 1-18 left to right but are sometimes numbered in a different way in which the 8 tall column are numbered followed by the letter A, thus skipping over the shorter columns. So group 1 is also called 1A, group 2 is called 2A, and group 13 (the next tall column) is also known as group 3A. The tall “A” columns in the periodic table are referred to as the main group elements. The short columns that separate groups 2A and 3A are referred to as the transition metals. Below the periodic table are two additional rows of elements called the lanthanides and actinides, respectively. These rows would occur between groups 2 and 3 in the periodic table, but are often dropped to the bottom to save space and make sure that the periodic table isn’t too long. Since the elements in the lanthanides and actinides are relatively rare, we will not be discussing them much in this class.   Exercise 3: Periodic table of elements     What element is in…    group 2, period 3    group 4A, period 4    group 15, period 5    group 8A, period 2      What are the symbols for the following elements?

How many protons does sodium have?

The elements carbon, oxygen, sulfur, chlorine, neon, radon, and iodine are all non-metals. Where do metals usually occur in the periodic table? How about non-metals?    Metals are shiny, silver in color (usually), good conductors of heat and electricity, and they’re ductile and malleable. Define ductile and malleable.

How many electrons can be fit into each shell      Orbitals    Shapes of orbitals    How many orbitals of each type are there    What orbitals are in which electron shells       Section 1: Atomic mass   At the bottom of a square in the periodic table is the value of the atomic mass  The weighted average of the masses of the isotopes found in nature. The weighting is based on the natural abundance of each isotope. in units of amu. Look at this number for carbon (12.011). This number is clearly different than the mass number since it is not an integer. However the calculation used to determine the atomic mass of an element relies on the mass numbers of the naturally occurring isotopes. To calculate atomic mass, we calculate the weighted average  A way of averaging that takes into account how frequently a value occurs in the sampling. of the various isotopes that are found in nature.  What is a weighted average? It’s a way of averaging that takes into account how frequently each isotope occurs in nature. For instance, if a class of 5 students had the following exam scores: 90, 80, 90, 90, 90 you wouldn’t simply average 80 and 90 to find the average. Instead you would add up each of the numbers (90+80+90+90+90=440) and then divide by 5. Another way of doing this is to weight each of the scores by writing how frequently it occurs:     Since 90 occurred 4 times we can multiply it by 4 and then add 80 rather than adding 90 four times. Alternatively, you could reach the same result by knowing that 20% of the class got an 80 and 80% of the class scored a 90. To use the percentages, we can assume that we have any class size, but assuming a class size of 100 people makes the calculation easiest. If we had 100 students in the class, then 20 of them would have a score of 80 and 80 of them would have a score of 90. We would multiply each score by the values of these percentages and then divide the result by the number of students that we assumed were in the class (100). The calculation would look like this and gives the exact same result:     When we calculate the atomic mass, we do a similar thing. Similar to the example above we have percent abundances for each element (ex. 20% of the isotope in the name have a certain mass number). To use percentages in a weighted average we assume that if we had 100 isotopes that that the value of the percentage is how many isotopes would have that mass. If we multiply each mass number by its percent occurrence, add then together, and then divide by 100, then we get the atomic mass. See below:  If an element has the following isotopes that are found in nature, calculate the atomic mass of the element:         Mass number  Percent abundance  Number of isotopes with that mass in a group of 100 isotopes    44  15.5  15.5    46  34.5  34.5    47  50.0  50.0     We calculate that atomic mass by taking each mass number and multiplying it by the number of isotopes of that mass that we’d expect in a group of 100 isotopes. After that we add the masses together and then divide by the total number of isotopes that we’re averaging (100).          Calculate the atomic mass of an element with the following isotopes…Round your answer to the tenths place:          Mass number  Percent abundance    72  3.1    73  44.9    74  52.0       Chlorine has two major isotopes, one with a mass of 35 and the other with a mass of 37.

This fact makes them the most important subatomic particle when we’re trying to understand the reactivity properties of an atom. Why? If two atoms are going to interact with one another, their electrons are going to be the type of subatomic particle that will first interact between the atoms. In order to be able to make sense of the reactivity properties of atoms, we need to understand how electrons are arranged around an atom.  Niels Bohr came up with the first model of the atom that sought to explain where the atoms are around the nucleus. His model sought to do two things: 1. To explain why negatively charged electrons don’t fall into the positively charge nucleus and 2. why hydrogen is able to emit light with very specific amounts of energy. His model proposed the idea that the electrons in an atom are placed into orbits around the nucleus (similar to satellites around Earth). If the electrons move fast enough, then they will never fall into the nucleus. Also, if we know the mass of an electron and its velocity we can calculate the amount of energy that an electron has in its orbit. Electrons in different orbits would have different velocities and thus different amounts of energy. The observation that hydrogen emits light with specific energies could be explained if electrons hopped from one orbit to another, giving off their excess energy as light.    A diagram of a group of blue dots and red dots AI-generated content may be incorrect.   How many electrons can each shell hold? Lower shell numbers are closer to the nucleus, and thus have less room for electrons than higher numbered shells. Each shell is capable of holding a certain number of electrons, and this is given by the equation:     So the first shell can hold , the 2 nd can hold , and so on.   Exercise 3: Electron shells     Electrons in ___________ (inner\/outer) shells are more easily removed from an atom.    Electrons in the 1 st shell are ________________(closer\/farther) from the nucleus than electrons in the 3 rd shell.    Explain the discovery that led scientists to develop the model of electron shells.    Determine the number of electrons in the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th shells.     Section 3: Orbitals   It was later revealed that the Bohr model was sufficient in some ways. Electron shells could explain the structure of a hydrogen atom, but failed to explain the experimental data for any other element. The reason for this is that once you have more than one electron, they begin to interact with one another. This necessitated the inclusion of orbitals  Regions of an atom where there is a high probability of finding an electron , which are regions within a shell that electrons can occupy. The idea of electron shells didn’t go away; instead the theory was modified to say that shells are more complex than originally thought. Orbitals exist within each shell and define regions where electrons are likely to be.  There are different types of orbitals, and each type is a set of different shapes that electrons can occupy. The orbital sets are given the letters: s, p, d, and f (see the following link to see their shapes: https:\/\/www.sciencefacts.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Atomic-Orbital.jpg ). S-orbitals are spherical in shape and occur around the nucleus. P-orbitals come in sets of 3, and each member of the set looks like a dumbbell or infinity symbol. D-orbitals come in sets of 5, with most of them looking like clovers. F-orbitals come in sets of 7 and have even more complicated shapes. You should be able to recognize and draw the s, p, and d orbital shapes and you should know how many come in a set.  So how do orbitals relate to shells? First of all, you need to know that orbitals can hold 2 electrons. The s-orbital comes in groups of 1, and thus that single orbital in the set can hold 2 electrons. Each of the p-orbitals in a set of 3 can hold 2 electrons, for a total of 6 electrons. Each of the d-orbitals holds 2 electrons and since they come in sets of 5, a set of d-orbitals holds 10 electrons. Now let’s go back to the shells. The first shell holds 2 electrons based on the formula given above. The only set of orbitals that can give two electrons is the s-orbital. So the first shell only contains one s-orbital and it is designated as the 1s orbital (meaning first shell s-orbital). The second shell contains 8 electrons. No set of orbitals by itself can give us 8 electrons, but the combination of a set of s-orbitals and p-orbitals can together hold 8 electrons (2 electrons from the s-orbital and 6 from the three p-orbitals). So the 2 nd shell has a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. In order to get 18 electrons for the third shell, we need a 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and five 3d orbitals. For the fourth shell a 4s orbital, three 4p orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and seven 4f orbitals are required. Hopefully you’re noticing a pattern. The 5 th shell and up should require additional orbital types, but there are no known elements that require orbitals beyond the f-orbitals. The table below summarizes this information.

How many electrons are in the 3 rd shell? How many orbitals are needed to hold that number of electrons? How can you get that number of orbitals by combining together different orbital sets?    How many electrons can a single 4p orbital hold? How many electrons can the set of 4p orbitals hold? How many electrons can a single 5d orbital hold? How about the set of 5d orbitals?    Which orbital type has a shape similar to a ball? An hour-glass? A four-leaf clover?    For the table above, make a 6 th row and fill in the missing information.

  "body": " Electron arrangement   Summary:     Electron configuration of an atom    Periodic table is arranged into blocks corresponding to the type of orbitals being filled      Valence electrons    How to figure out the number of valence electrons in an atom    Stable configurations       Section 1: Electron configurations and valence electrons   Now that we know where we can put electrons in an atom, we can start to fill these orbitals with the number of electrons that an atom has. In general the order that we fill will proceed from the lowest shell number to the highest because lower shell numbers have lower energy than higher shell numbers (making filling them preferable…here’s an analogy, is it easier to put a bowling ball on the floor at the bottom of a set of stairs or to carry it up and put it on the top step…similarly nature prefers lower energy states to higher states.  Way number 1 to figure out the filling order:    Make a diagram listing all of the possible orbitals as shown below (one of the exercises will have you practice making this drawing)          Begin drawing diagonal lines starting at the top. The order that you draw through the diagonal lines is the order that the orbitals get filled          Figure out the order: 1s<2s<2p<3s<3p<4s<3d<4p<5s<4d<5p<6s…    Before I show you the other way to find the orbital filling order, it’ll be helpful to start filling these orbitals with electrons. We have to remember that each orbital holds 2 electrons and that s-orbitals come in groups of 1, p’s in groups of 3, d’s in groups of 5, and f’s in groups of 7. This means that s-orbitals hold up to 2 electrons, p’s up to 6, d’s up to 10, and f’s up to 14. We’ll start simple with hydrogen. A neutral hydrogen atom only has one electron (given by it’s atomic number of 1). That electron will be placed in the lowest energy orbital (the 1s). We denote the number of electrons in a set of orbitals with a superscript after the orbital. So hydrogen has the electron configuration . For an atom of helium, we have two electrons. The 1s orbital can hold two electrons, so it’s configuration is . For lithium, we have 3 electrons, this additional electron needs to go into the next lowest orbital so its configuration is . Similarly beryllium is . After this, we have boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon with electron configurations of , , , and respectively. With larger and larger elements, the electron configurations get longer and longer to write out. Thankfully we have an abbreviated way of accomplishing this which is shown in the box below, along with another way of figuring out the orbital filling order:  The position of an element in the periodic table can tell us the orbital and shell numbers that are being filled as shown below:      Using this diagram we can fill the electron configuration of any atom. In the first row, we’re crossing the s-block, so those electrons go into the 1s orbital. The first two elements in the 2 nd row will have additional electrons in their 2s orbital (because they are in the s-block) then the next 6 will have their additional electrons put in the 2p orbitals. Next comes 3s and 3p with the elements in the 3 rd row. In the 4 th row, we cross the s block (4s), then the d-block (3d; note that the d shell number is always one less than the row number), then the 4p. To abbreviate long electron configurations, the noble-gas shorthand is used. When doing this, we proceed BACKWARDS to the nearest noble gas and write its symbol in brackets to indicate that this element has the same electron configuration as that noble gas, plus the extra orbitals that we’ll soon indicate. We then add on the additional orbitals and electrons from the row that the element we’re interested is in. So for potassium (K), if we back up to the nearest noble gas, we find argon. The additional electrons for potassium are in the 4 th row. There is only 1 additional electron in the s-block so the electron configuration is . Similarly, for cadmium, we’d back up to find krypton. The additional electrons (12 of them) are in the 5 th row and we have to cross the s and d blocks. So the electron configuration would be .   Exercise 1: Electron configurations     Recreate the drawing in the table above that illustrates the orbital filling order. Then do it a second time on a clean sheet of paper, trying to create it from memory.    Try to add more arrows than the arrows shown in the diagram provided. What orbital gets filled after the 6d orbital      What orbital gets filled after the:    3s    2p    5s    4p    4d      Write the electron configuration for the following atoms in both long form and using the noble gas shorthand    P    Se    Ni    Al    Mg       Section 2: Valence electrons   The noble gas shorthand does a good job of emphasizing the electrons that are in the outermost shell (highest number shell) of the atom. These electrons are called valence electrons  Electrons that are in the outermost (or highest energy) electron shell of an atom. . They are very important because if two atoms come together to react with one another, the outer most electrons are the ones that are going to be controlling how they interact. We can find the number of electrons from the electron configuration quite easily. Take carbon for example. Its electron configuration is or . There are 4 electrons in the 2 nd shell (the highest numbered shell for carbon), so it has 4 valence electrons. Silicon, which is in the same group and has similar reactivity properties has the electron configuration and thus also has 4 valence electrons. We can figure out the number of valence electrons from the electron configuration, but we can figure them out even easier for the main group elements (ie. those elements in the tall columns) by simply looking at the main group number. Carbon is in group 4A and thus has 4 valence electrons. Fluorine is in group 7A and thus has 7 valence electrons.  Thus, every element in a particular group (at least in the main group; we won’t worry about the transition metals for this part) of the periodic table will have the same number of valence electrons. Recall that elements in the same group in the periodic table have similar chemical and physical properties. The reason for this is that every element in a group has the name number of valence electrons. This can also highlight particularly stable and unstable arrangements of electrons. Answer the exercise questions to shed some light on this.   Exercise 2: Valence electrons     How many valence electrons do the following elements have?    Mg    H    S    Br    Xe      The noble gases are in group 8A. The noble gases are known for being very stable; it’s extremely difficult to make them react with anything else.    How many valence electrons do the noble gases have (with the exception of helium)?    This number of valence electrons is therefore particularly __________ (stable\/unstable).      The alkali metals are in group 1. They react violently when placed into water.    How many valence electrons do they have?    Is this number of electrons stable or unstable?    If sodium loses one electron:    What would its electron configuration be?    How many valence electrons would it now have?    Would you expect it to be more stable or less stable?    What would the charge be on the new sodium ion?        The halogens are in group 7A. They react violently with many compounds, especially metals.    How many valence electrons do they have?    Is this number of electrons stable or unstable?    If chlorine gains one electron:    What would its electron configuration be?    How many valence electrons would it now have?    Would you expect it to be more stable or less stable?    What would the charge be on the new chlorine ion?

Radiation is the emission of energy from an object in the form of electromagnetic radiation (which we covered previously) or in the form of parts of atoms. Importantly, radiation doesn’t imply a specific cause for the energy emission. Radioactivity produces radiation, but from a very specific source. In radioactivity, an atom has an unstable nucleus, and that nucleus becomes stable, and in the process releases radiation. There are other sources of radiation other than radioactivity. Radioactivity will always produce radiation.  Now that we’ve clarified those two terms, let’s begin to learn about radioactivity in more detail. In the last chapter, we learned about isotopes. To review, isotopes are atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons and thus different mass numbers. Some isotopes of atoms are stable, whereas other isotopes have unstable nuclei. These nuclei can stabilize themselves by emitting energy or particles. This is called radioactive decay. Radioactive decay causes that isotope to emit radiation. The radiation that is emitted can be different for different isotopes. forms that we’ll be learning about, because of their relevance to medicine are gamma radiation, beta particles, alpha particles, neutrons, protons, and positrons.  What are these different forms of radiation. We’ve previously learned about gamma rays. Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation or light energy. Out of the different forms of electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays have the highest energies. The other forms of radiation that we’re going to cover are particles. It’s often helpful to group the particles together based on their similarities and differences.  Some radioactive isotopes emit gamma radiation . This emission is in the form of a photon (or light) that has energy of a gamma ray. The emission of a gamma ray is caused by an unstable nucleus relaxing to a lower energy state and emitting the lost energy as light. Unlike the other types of radioactive emission, gamma rays are massless and lack charge.  Other types of radioactive isotopes decay and emit particles. These types of particles are alpha particles, beta particles, positrons, protons, and neutrons. These particles vary in their mass and charge. Alpha particles have the greatest mass. They are essentially a helium atom nucleus. They consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons that are fused together into the largest of the particles that we’ll discuss. Beta particles are essentially electrons that are ejected from an atoms as a part of radioactive emission. However, they are ejected from the nucleus rather than from the cloud of electrons around the atom (we’ll discuss how this works more in the next section). Positrons are antimatter particles. They have the same mass as an electron, but they’re positively charged. When antimatter positrons collide with electrons, they annihilate one another and their mass is turned into energy in the form of gamma rays. We’ve already discussed protons and neutrons. Their masses and charges are the same that we’ve previously discussed, even when they are ejected from an atom as a part of radioactive decay.   Exercise 1:     Do the following particles have mass? If they do, round their mass to the nearest amu.    Gamma ray    Beta-particle    Proton    Alpha particle    Neutron    Positron      What is the charge of the following particles?    Gamma ray    Beta-particle    Proton    Alpha particle    Neutron    Positron      How many protons and neutrons are in the following nuclei?    Cobalt-57    Uranium-238    Fluorine-18       Balancing decay reactions   When radioactive decay occurs, changes happen to the radioactive atom. In most cases, the emission of the radiation results in a change in the nucleus of the atom and can even change one element into another element. To describe the changes that take place after radioactive decay, we can write a radioactive decay equation. The guiding principle when writing a radioactive decay equation is that the total mass and total charge cannot change after the decay has occurred.  The first type of decay equation that we’ll explore is gamma decay. Unlike other forms of radioactivity, there is no change in the composition of the nucleus. Instead the nucleus simply changes from a high energy state (called a metastable state) to a low energy state. This makes balancing nuclear decay equations that involve gamma emission very easy. See the example below:     In this equation, the superscript m indicates that the nucleus of iodine-125 is metastable (semi-stable\/unstable). The Greek letter gamma is used to represent the emitted gamma ray.  Two other types of radioactivity (which are quite similar) are beta particles and positrons. Beta particles and positrons are both particles that are emitted from the nucleus. Both of them have mass (although it is very small and often rounded to 0 amu, similar to an electron). Also, both beta particles and positrons have charge; beta particles are negatively charged while positrons are positively charged. When nuclei emit a particle that has charge, the remaining charge in the nucleus has to change; the charge that is emitted has to come from somewhere (it isn’t simply created). This results in the nucleus having the same mass, but a different number of protons. When the number of protons changes, the identity of the atom actually changes from one element to another. See the examples below:              Equation 1 represents a beta-particle emission. The symbol represents the beta-particle and implies that it has 0 mass and an atomic number (or charge, since we’re focusing solely on the nucleus) of -1. Sometimes beta-particles are represented in other ways, such as or , but they mean the exact same thing. Equation 2 represents a positron emission with the representing the positron (other times it may be represented by or ). Note that in both cases, the identity of the isotope changes after the particle is emitted. This is because nuclear decay equations must balance both charge and mass on both sides of the equation. Since beta-particles and positrons lack mass, the mass number of the resulting isotope remains the same as it was in the beginning (in equation 1 the mass is 3 before and after emission; in equation 2, the mass is 18 before and after emission). Now let’s talk about how we figure out the atomic number of the resulting isotope. First, recall that the atomic number of an atom is ALWAYS the number of protons in the nucleus. Since protons are positively charged, the atomic number also ALWAYS gives us the charge of the nucleus of an atom. So, in equation 1, the nucleus of hydrogen began with a charge of +1. Since a beta particle was emitted, and since it has a charge of -1 then the resulting nucleus must have a charge of +2 (because +2 +(-1)= +1). We can figure this out by making a simple equation that states that the charge on the left equals the charge on the right:     We can do the same for positron emission in equation 2:     Once we know the atomic number of the resulting isotope (2 or 8 respectively in the examples above), then we can figure out which element they represent (He and O respectively).  So how do positron and beta-particle emissions work? How is the number of protons changing? When a beta-particle is emitted, a neutron is actually changing into a beta-particle plus a proton. The negative charge of the beta particle balances out the positive charge of the proton, hence why they both come from a neutral particle. So every time a beta-particle is emitted the mass remains the same (because protons and neutrons have masses of 1 amu), but the number of protons increases by one and the number of neutrons decreases by one. When a positron is emitted, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron. Thus a proton is lost, and the atomic number decreases by one, but a new neutron appears to preserve the mass.  Another type of radioactivity is an alpha particle. Alpha particles have mass and charge, specifically a mass of 4 amu and a charge of +2. They are therefore the same as a helium nucleus. When we are balancing a nuclear decay equation involving alpha particle emission, we need to make sure to balance both mass and charge. See the example below:         Note that the mass numbers are balanced on both sides of the reaction arrow as are the atomic numbers (or nuclear charge). The alpha particle is denoted in equation 3.  Finally, radioactive decay can result in the ejection of protons or neutrons from the nucleus. When a proton decay occurs a particle is ejected. When neutron decay occurs the ejected particle is . The rules for writing the decay equations for other types of particles still applies in these cases. We simply need to ensure that the total nuclear charge is the same on both sides of the equation AND that the mass is the same on both sides of the equation as well.   Exercise 2:      Write a balanced nuclear decay equation for the following:      The beta decay of carbon-14      The alpha decay of radon-220      The gamma decay of cobalt-60      The positron emission of magnesium-23      The neutron emission of krypton-87      The proton emission of cobalt-47        What type of radiation is emitted in the following processes:      The conversion of metastable Tc-99 to stable Tc-99      The conversion of carbon-11 to boron-11      Polonium-210 changing to lead-206                       What type(s) of radioactive emission…      involves particles with non-negligible masses      produces a positively charge particle      causes the nucleus to increase in atomic number by 1      causes the nucleus to decrease in atomic number by 1      increases the number of neutrons in the nucleus      decreases the number of neutrons in the nucleus      causes no change in the identity of the element        Section 3: Uses of radioactive materials   Radioactive materials have numerous uses in energy production, science, and medicine. We’ll cover a few as a part of this section.  Nuclear power plants rely on isotopes that undergo neutron decay to initiate a process called nuclear fission . Nuclear fission is a different type of nuclear decay in which a nucleus splits. This splitting is caused by the impact of a high energy neutron (which is produced by neutron decay) on a nucleus. The impact results in an unstable nucleus that undergoes nuclear fission. When a nucleus splits, smaller nuclei are produced along with other neutrons. These neutrons can impact the nuclei of other atoms causing them to undergo nuclear fission. This leads to a chain reaction where the splitting of one nucleus leads to particles that can cause the splitting of other nuclei. Every time a nucleus undergoes fission, some of the mass of the nucleus is turned into energy. This energy can be used to heat water to a boil and the resulting steam can be used to turn a turbine and produce electricity.  Nuclear power can produce vast amounts of power without the production of greenhouse gases. However, nuclear power generates a large amount of radioactive waste. The nuclei that are produced after fission are often radioactive themselves. This presents a challenge for us to figure out ways to safely store these waste products. In addition, the radioactive materials that are needed to cause the chain reactions (namely uranium-235) are a limited resource that requires a lot of effort to mine and purify.  Radioactive isotopes are used in medicine as tracers or as therapeutics. Tracers are chemicals that can help doctors pinpoint the location of problems. In a PET scan, for instance, a patient is treated with isotopes that emit positrons. When positrons are emitted in the human body, they are quickly annihilated by the electrons in the surrounding tissues. This annihilation produces gamma rays that can be detected by specialized cameras. This allows doctors to detect the location of the positron emitting isotopes in the human body. For example, PET scans can be used to detect tumors. In this usage, the patient is fed radioactive sugar. Cancer cells take up sugar much more quickly than most tissues in the human body. As a result the radioactive isotopes accumulate in the tumor and begin emitting more positrons there. By detecting the resulting gamma rays, doctors can easily detect the precise location of a tumor.  Another medical use of radioactive materials is in radiation therapy. In radiation therapy, radioactive materials are placed in or near a tumor. Radiation can impact the tumor, leading to destruction of the molecules in those cells and ultimately the death of those cells. Unfortunately the damage is hard to confine to the tumor, and often surrounding tissues are damaged in the process, resulting in side effects.   Exercise 3:      Explain how a chain reaction is used to produce nuclear power.      Why are gamma ray cameras used to detect positrons in a PET scan?      How do doctors get cancer cells to accumulate radioactive materials prior to a PET scan?      Which type of radiation do you think would be more damaging to tissues, an alpha particle or a beta-particle? Why?         Key   Exercise 1    Do the following particles have mass? If they do, round their mass to the nearest amu.    No    Yes, 0 amu    Yes, 1 amu    Yes, 4 amu    Yes, 1 amu    Yes, 0 amu      What is the charge of the following particles?    0    -1    +1    +2    0    +1      How many protons and neutrons are in the following nuclei?    27 protons 30 neutrons    92 protons 146 neutrons    9 protons 9 neutrons      Exercise 2:                                        Gamma    Positron    Alpha    Beta    Proton    neutron        Alpha, proton, neutron    Positron, proton, and alpha    Beta    Positron, proton    Positron    Beta, neutron, and alpha    Gamma and neutron      Exercise 3:     A neutron impacts a nucleus of one atom, leading to nuclear fission and energy release. This fission releases more neutrons. These neutrons can impact other nuclei causing them to similarly undergo fission and release energy      Positrons annihilate when they encounter electrons in the atoms surrounding the positron emitters. This annihilation releases energy in the form of gamma rays      Radioactive sugar is given to the patient. Cancer cells take up and use sugar quicker than other types of tissues because they are actively growing.      Alpha particles have a greater impact because of their larger charge.     "

Radioactivity has the potential to cause chemical changes to our cells which can lead to cell death, mutations, and cancer. One of the easiest ways to minimize our risk is to use the lowest amount of radioactive isotope possible. The question then arises…how do we measure radioactivity. Radioactivity can be measured by a variety of devices, depending on the type of emission. In all cases, the SI unit that is used to measure radioactivity is a becquerel (abbreviated Bq), which is the same as one radioactive decay (or disintegration) every second. The nuclei of a radioactive isotope will randomly decay, releasing radioactivity. If a sample contains more nuclei or is more enriched in radioactive nuclei (ie. there are more radioactive nuclei and fewer non-radioactive nuclei) then the sample will produce more radiation every second, leading to a higher Bq value. Another historically important unit of measure for radioactivity is a Curie (abbreviated Ci). A Curie is a much larger quantity than a becquerel and represents 3.7 x10 10 decays per second or that same number of becquerels. A Curie often represents a very large amount of radiation, so it’s common for laboratory personnel to use smaller metric prefixes along with Curies, such as mCi or µCi.  The units of Curies and becquerels are used to describe how much radiation an object emits. The emission of radioactivity from an object moves in all directions, and thus a large percentage of that radiation may never enter the body of a patient or medical professional. To describe the amount of radiation that actually enters the body, scientists use a different unit called a rad . This unit has since been replaced by the SI unit of grey ( abbreviated Gy; one Gy is the same as 100 rad).  To quantify the damaging effects of absorbed radiation, scientists use the unit rem (radiation equivalent in man). Rem can be easily calculated from rad by multiplying it by a damage factor that is specific to the type of radioactive particle that’s being absorbed. In general, gamma rays, beta particles, and positrons cause the least amount of damage (and thus have a factor of 1), protons and neutrons cause moderate damage (and have a factor of 10), and alpha particles cause the most damage (and have a factor of 20). Another unit that is used to measure the effect of absorbed radiation is a Sievert (abbreviated Sv) . One Sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. How much radiation is too much? An average person receives about 3 mSv of radiation per year. A single x-ray or a CT scan subject a person to 0.1-10 mSv of radiation. At a dose of 50 mSv, there is a statistically detectable increase in a person’s cancer risk. Radiation sickness can begin to set in with doses of 0.5 Sv (notice the change from mSv with the previous doses). A dose of 3-4 Sv is generally fatal to ~50% of people who receive that high of a dose.   Exercise 1:     Convert 18 Ci to Bq    Convert 5.3 x 10 8 Bq to mCi.    Which sample is more radioactive, one with 4.3 µCi or one with 5.77 x 10 5 Bq?    Describe the difference between rad, Bq, and rem in terms of what they are measuring.    If a patient receives a dose of 54.3 rad of alpha particles…    How many Gy did they receive?    What is the biological impact of the radiation in units of rem?    What is the biological impact of the radiation in units of Sv?    Would you expect the person who received the dose in c to survive or be sick?    Recalculate b and c if the radiation was beta-particles instead.       Radiation safety   Radiation can pose safety risks to humans, but if users are careful, the health impacts can be minimized. In order to avoid harm from radiation, there are 3 things to consider:    Amount of radiation used    Time    Distance    Shielding    Whenever radioactive materials or other radiation sources are used, we should be careful to use the least amount possible. As you’d expect, by using lower amounts of radioactive materials, we can lessen the total exposure to radiation as well as the total amount of possible damage.  Likewise, biological damage from radiation can be lessened by spending the minimal amount of time in an environment with a radiation source. In general, the more time a person spends near a radiation source, the greater their exposure to radiation and therefore the greater the amount of biological damage that will occur.  Another important consideration is the distance between the radioactive material (or radiation source) and the person being exposed. There is a mathematical relationship between the amount of radiation a person’s body absorbs and the distance from the radiation source. The intensity of radiation decreases by the square of the distance increase from the radiation source. If you are standing 2 m from a radiation source, you would receive ¼ the radiation exposure that you would receive if you were standing 1 m away. This is because the same amount of radiation becomes spread over a larger area as the distance increases. The impact of distance on radiation intensity is described by the inverse square law equation:     Where and are the radiation intensities at the first ( ) and second ( ) distances respectively.  Finally, various forms of radiation can be blocked by different types of shielding. In general, the larger the particle and more charged it is, the less shielding required. Alpha particles, the most massive radioactive particles, can be blocked by a sheet of paper or by our outer layer of skin. For alpha particle emitters to cause biological damage, they must typically be ingested or incorporated into the body by some other means. Beta-particles can be shielded by about a centimeter of aluminum, plastic, or plexiglass. Neutrons (no charge) and gamma rays (no mass or charge) are much more difficult to shield. Radioactive sources that emit these forms of radiation often require lead or concrete shielding to block exposure.   Exercise 2:     List the 4 ways that we can help lessen our exposure to radiation when working with radioactive materials    What type of radiation is the easiest to block with shielding? Which types are the hardest to block?    Think about what you know about the mass and charge of each of the types of radiation. How does that information relate to how easy it is to block that type of radiation?    A person would be exposed to 4.0 mGy of radiation if they were 10.0 m from the radiation source. How much radiation would they be exposed to if they were instead:    20.0 m from the radiation source    100. m from the radiation source    2.5 m from the radiation source      Rearrange the equation below to solve for :         Use the rearranged equation in question 5 to answer the following question: A worker needs to keep their radiation exposure below 5.0 mGy. If they would be exposed to 15 mGy of radiation at a distance of 2.5 m, what is the closest they can get to the radiation source without exceeding their maximum dose?     Half-life on radioisotopes   Radioactive isotopes decay in a random fashion. As they decay, the atoms in the sample change and the sample can gradually lose its radioactive properties, simply because there is less and less of the original radioactive isotope left. We measure the decay rate of radioactive isotopes using half-lives. One half life is the amount of time required to have the decay rate of a substance decrease by a factor of one-half. So after one half life, half of the original isotope remains and the decay rate will thus be ½ of what it originally was. After a second half life has passed, one-half of one-half of the original radioactive isotope will remain (or ¼). After each subsequent half-life the amount of original radioactive isotope will again decrease by ½. We can use this information to derive a formula to calculate the amount of radioactive isotope or the decay rate after a given amount of time has passed:     In this formula is the decay rate or amount of isotope at time t and is the original rate or amount. The variables and represent the time that has passed and the half-life of the isotope respectively. So if we began with 17 mCi of radioactive material that has a half-life of 8 days and 30 days have passed, we’d have mCi of radioactive material left. Half lives of isotopes can vary dramatically with short ones having half-lives of seconds or minutes and long ones having half-lives of thousands of years. Isotopes that are used clinically generally have short half-lives (on the order of days or weeks) because that means that they will decay at a fast rate meaning that they can produce their useful radiation dose more quickly with less material required.   Exercise 3:      After 5 half lives, what fraction of the original radioactive material will remain?      How about after 7 half-lives?        After 4 half-lives what percentage of the original radioactive material will remain? Round to 3 significant figures      If 28.5 mg of radioactive material with a half live of 17 days is allowed to decay for 8 days, then how much will remain? Round to 3 significant figures      5.2 x 10 7 Bq of radioactive material is purchased. It has a half life of 23 hours. After exactly 7 days, how much radioactive material will remain? Round to 2 significant figures      A lab orders 16 mCi of radioactive material. After 8 days, 2.0 mCi remains. What is the half life of the material? Round to the nearest tenth of a day.      Key   Exercise 1:    6.7 x 10 11 Bq    14 mCi    160,000Bq=4.3microCuries this is less than 577,000 Bq    Bq is a measure of the amount of radiation released from a source.

There are two different classes of compounds: ionic compounds and covalent\/molecular compounds. In this section, we’ll be learning about the differences between ionic compounds and covalent compounds. What distinguishes ionic compounds from covalent\/molecular compounds is the way in which the atoms are joined together.   Ionic compounds are made up of ions that are joined together by electrostatic forces . Ions are particles that have a net charge, either a positive or a negative charge. Ions can either be positively charged ( cations ) or negatively charges ( anions ). Additionally, ions can either consist of one atom (a monoatomic ion) or of several atoms that are joined together to form a larger charged unit (a polyatomic ion). An ionic compound consists of cations and anions that are held together because their opposite charges attract one another (electrostatic forces).   Covalent compounds (also known as molecular compounds ) are formed from atoms that are joined together by sharing electrons. Ionic compounds always consist of multiple ions, which are separate units that are attracted to one another. In contrast, covalent compounds consist of a single unit that is comprised of all of the component atoms. Within this unit, the atoms are held together by the sharing of electrons. This unit of a covalent compound is called a molecule .  Ionic compounds generally (but not always…we’ll learn about the exceptions later) consist of a metal and one or more non-metals. Covalent compounds, on the other hand, consist exclusively of non-metals. This can be useful in allowing us to identify whether a compound is an ionic or covalent compound. Recall that metals can be found on the left side of the periodic table whereas non-metals can be found exclusively on the upper right. Thus, if a compound contains a metal, we can be confident that it is an ionic compound. If a compound doesn’t contain a metal, it is usually a covalent compound (again, we’ll learn about exceptions to this in a later section).  These atomic-level differences between ionic and covalent compounds lead to very different physical properties. The physical properties that we’ll be learning about are melting point and behavior in solution. In general, ionic compounds have much higher melting points than covalent compounds. In a solid ionic compound, the ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces as we learned above. In a solid covalent compound, the various molecules are themselves held together, but by much weaker intermolecular forces . We’ll discuss intermolecular forces in much more detail later in this chapter. Since the forces that hold together ions in an ionic compound are much stronger than the intermolecular forces that hold together molecules in a covalent compound, more energy is required to break the bonds in an ionic compound. This results in a higher melting point.  There is a big difference between ionic and covalent compounds when it comes to how they can dissolve in water to form a solution. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the electrostatic interactions between the ions are replaced by interactions between the ions and water. Basically, the ions that make up the ionic compound separate from one another and get surrounded by water molecules. When covalent compounds dissolve in water, they remain as intact molecules. Each molecule is surrounded by water molecules similar to what is seen for an ionic compound. The difference is that molecules remain intact whereas the ions that make up ionic compounds separate from one another.   Exercise 1:      Classify the following as a monoatomic cation, a monoatomic anion, a polyatomic cation, or a polyatomic anion      Ca 2+      Mn 2+      NH 4 +      ClO 4 -      Cl -      O 2-      SO 4 2-        What term describes the forces that hold together the ions in an ionic compound?      What term describes all of the forces that hold together molecules in a molecular compound?      For each of the following, do they describe a molecular compound or an ionic compound      Parts of the chemical formula break apart when they are dissolved into water      Low melting points      Usually contains metal ions        Section 2: Ions   In this section, we’ll be learning about how atoms form ions. First of all, what is an ion. We’ve learned that an ion is a species that is charged. So how does it get its charge? It does so by having extra electrons or by lacking electrons. If an atom has more electrons than protons, then its charge will be negative and it will be an anion. If an atom has fewer electrons than protons, then the atom will be positively charges, and it will be a cation. Importantly, the number of protons will NEVER change for an element. Ions are created by either adding or removing electrons.  Why do some atoms gain electrons whereas other atoms lose them? Why do some gain\/lose a single electron whereas others gain\/lose multiple? To understand this, we need to revisit electron configurations. The most stable elements on the periodic table are the noble gases. Why are they so stable? It turns out that they are stable because their orbitals are either completely filled or completely empty! For instance, the electron configuration of helium is and the electron configuration of neon is (recall that a set of s-orbitals hold 2 electrons, a set of p orbitals can hold 6…etc.). For all of the noble gases except helium, they have 8 valence electrons (helium has 2). Thus the most stable electron configurations will have 8 valence electrons, something known as the octet rule .  For many elements, they form ions in order to get an electron configuration that is the same as a noble gas. For instance, if a group 1 metal loses a single electron, then it will have the same electron configuration as a noble gas (ex. the electron configuration of sodium is and if it loses its outermost valence electron then its electron configuration will simply be or simply ). Because of this, group 1 metals tend to lose a single electron to form ions. Elements in group 2 tend to lose 2 electrons, because this will give them an electron configuration that is the same as a noble gas as well. On the other side of the periodic table, the halogens (group 17 or 7A) have electron configurations that are a single electron away from resembling a noble gas. In order for them to reach a noble gas configuration, they have to GAIN one electron. As a result they’ll form negatively charged anions. Elements in group 16 will likewise gain two electrons to achieve a noble gas electron configuration.  Many of the elements in the periodic table have predictable charges in ionic compounds. The metals in group 1 will always have a +1 charge. The metals in group 2 will always have a +2 charge. Aluminum will likewise always have a +3 charge. The halogens (group 17 or 7A) will always for anions with a -1 charge. The non-metals in group 16 (6A) will gain two electrons to form -2 anions. The non-metals in group 15 (5A), nitrogen and phosphorus, can gain 3 electrons to form -3 anions. Hydrogen is a rather unique element, in that it can lose one electron (forming a +1 ion with completely empty orbitals) or gain an electron to resemble helium (forming a -1 anion).   Exercise 2:      What is the electron configuration and charge of…      Calcium if it loses two electrons      Chlorine if it gains one electron      Hydrogen if it gains one electron      Hydrogen if it loses one electron      Sodium if it loses one electron      Aluminum if it loses 3 electrons      Phosphorus if it gains 3 electrons        Each of the ions in question 1 are common in ionic compounds. What do you notice about the electron configuration of each of the ions in question 1? Do you notice a pattern?      Which of the ions in question 1 are cations? Which are anions?      Keeping in mind that ions like to form electron configurations with either completely full or completely empty valence shells, what is the charge on each of the ions in the following ionic compounds. Their position on the periodic table may help.      Sodium ion      Strontium ion      Aluminum ion      Bromine ion      Sulfur ion      Nitrogen ion        Section 3: Simple ionic compounds   Ionic compounds are formed by combining cations and anions. When they are combined, they must do so in such a way that the total positive charge is equal to the total negative charge. Sometimes this is simple. For instance a ion can be combined with a ion in a 1:1 ratio because the +1 charge from the sodium balances the -1 charge from the chlorine. There would therefore be one of each ion in the chemical formula for this compound, and we’d write it simply as (note: if there’s one of an element in a chemical formula the 1 is not written). On the other hand, if we wanted to make an ionic compound by joining a ion with a ion, then we’d require 2 ions to balance the +2 charge on the calcium ion. Thus, they’d combine to form the compound (the number of ions is written as a subscript). Also, note that when we write the chemical formula of an ionic compound that we don’t include the charges of the ions!   Ionic compounds can be specified by their chemical formula (as covered above) or by their name. How do we name ionic compounds? Naming ionic compounds is easy. They consist of two separate words. The first word is the name of the cation, and the second word is the name of the anion. For simple ionic compounds that have metal cations with known charges, naming the cation is easy…it’s simply the name of that metal. The name of the anion is more complex. To name the anion, we start with the name of the element, but we delete the ending of the name and replace it with -ide. See the table below:        Element  Anion name    Oxygen  Oxide    Chlorine  Chloride    Bromine  Bromide    Nitrogen  Nitride    Phosphorous  Phosphide     Thus the name of is sodium chloride and would be calcium bromide. When we’re naming ionic compounds, we NEVER use prefixes to indicate the number of ions present. The number of ions is implied by our knowledge about the ions themselves and their charges. To illustrate this, lets figure out the chemical formula for magnesium oxide. We know that this compound consists of magnesium and oxygen. Based on their locations in the periodic table, we can conclude that magnesium would form a +2 ion and that oxygen would form a -2 ion. In order to get the positive and negative charges to balance, we’d need a 1:1 ratio so the correct formula would simply be .   Exercise 3:      Try to balance the positive and negative charge to create ionic compounds. What is the correct formula be for the following ionic compounds?

They resemble noble gases.      Each one that loses electrons is a cation, the ones that gain electrons are anions      Keeping in mind that ions like to form electron configurations with either completely full or completely empty valence shells, what is the charge on each of the ions in the following ionic compounds.

However, for many metals (such as the transition metals) it is unrealistic to expect them to lose enough electrons to achieve the same electron configuration as a noble gas. Instead, these metals will lose fewer electrons in an effort to empty out their outer s or p orbitals, or to obtain other stable electron configurations. Often there are multiple ways for these metals to achieve stable states, and therefore these metals can adopt different charge states. For instance, iron has the electron configuration . Iron can empty out its 4s shell, losing 2 electrons in the process, and forming a Fe 2+ ion. Alternatively, iron can empty its 4s shell AND lose an electron from its 3d shell. This results in a semi-stable half-filled 3d shell. In this case, iron has lost 3 electrons, forming a Fe 3+ ion in the process.  So which metals have variable charges and which ones don’t? The metals with known charges are listed below:    Metals in group 1 (+1 charge)    Metals in group 2 (+2 charge)    C.A.Z.A.G. metals    Cd, cadmium (+2 charge)    Al, aluminum (+3 charge)    Zn, zinc (+2 charge)    Ag, silver (+1 charge)    Ga, gallium (+3 charge)      All other metals in the periodic table have more than one possible charge.  How are we supposed to know what the charge of a metal is in an ionic compound if it has a metal with variable charges. When naming these types of ionic compounds, we specify the charge of the metal by putting the charge in parentheses as a Roman numeral (see the table below). Importantly, we ONLY do this if the metal in the ionic compound has variable charges. So the name iron (III) chloride is an ionic compound between Fe 3+ and Cl - ; the (III) specifies that the charge on the iron is 3+. Chloride is in group 17, and thus we can determine that its charge is -1 (because it only needs one extra electron to have a noble gas electron configuration). From this information, we can determine that the formula for iron (III) chloride must be because 3 chloride ions would be needed to balance out the charge of the iron.        Number  Roman numeral    1  I    2  II    3  III    4  IV    5  V    6  VI    7  VII    8  VIII     Likewise, we can figure out the name of an ionic compound that involves a metal with variable charges by figuring out the charge on the metal by looking at the known charge on the anion. For example, if you were tasked with naming the compound , you’d first need to recognize that tin is a metal with variable charges. In order to figure out its charge, we need to determine that oxide ions have a charge of -2. Since there are two oxides in the chemical formula, the total negative charge is 2(-2) = -4. The one Sn ion must have a positive charge that balances the negative charges from the oxides. Therefore the cation is Sn 4+ . To name the compound, we name the cation along with the charge in parentheses and then we name the anion. So the name of this compound is tin (IV) oxide.   Exercise 1:      What is the charge on the metal in the following ionic compounds. You need to figure out the charge on the metal based on the identity and quantity of the non-metals and the quantity of the metal in the compound. Remember that the positive and negative charges need to balance.     FeCl 3     FeCl 2     CoO    OsO 4     MnN    Sn 3 N 4     Sb 2 O 5        Name the ionic compounds in part 1. Remember that if an ionic compound has a metal with variable charges, then the charge on the metal is specified with a roman numeral in parentheses after the metal name      What are the formulas for the following compounds      Copper (I) sulfide      Copper (II) sulfide      Nickel (II) oxide      Manganese (III) chloride      Manganese (VII) oxide      Lead (IV) chloride        Section 2: Polyatomic ions   There are ions (both cations and anions) that consist of more than one atom, and these are called polyatomic  ions . These atoms are joined together by sharing electrons (covalent bonds) to form a single unit. This collective unit of atoms contains fewer electrons (if it’s a cation) or extra electrons (if it’s an anion), and thus the entire unit has a charge. We’ll explore the structures of these polyatomic ions later in this chapter. For now, we won’t worry about their structure. Rather we’ll focus on their component atoms and charges alone.  Polyatomic ions have names, formulas, and charges that must be memorized. There are some patterns to their naming that become apparent after close inspection, and these patterns will be looked at as a part of the exercises below. The polyatomic ions that you are responsible for knowing are listed in the table below:         Name  Charge  Formula with charge    Ammonium  +1     Carbonate  -2     Hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate)  -1     Phosphate  -3     Hydrogen phosphate (or phosphate dibasic)  -2     Dihydrogen phosphate (or phosphate monobasic)  -1     Sulfate  -2     Sulfite  -2     Nitrate  -1     Nitrite  -1     Hydroxide  -1     Acetate  -1      We can name ionic compounds that include polyatomic ions by following the same rules that we learned previously: we simply name the cation (with the charge, if needed) and then the anion. So if you have to name , you first of all, need to recognize that it’s an ionic compound (because it has a metal and nonmetals). Then you need to remember that sodium has a known charge (because it’s in group 1) and thus we won’t specify its charge in the name. Lastly, you need to recognize that is included in the formula and is called nitrate. Therefore, this compound is called sodium nitrate.  One additional complication that arises when discussing polyatomic ions is that there is one polyatomic ion, ammonium, that is a cation. Thus, we can have ionic compounds that don’t have metals. They will instead have ammonium ( ) as a part of their formula. So is an ionic compound that consists of an ammonium cation and a chloride anion. It is therefore named ammonium chloride.  Sometimes chemical formulas will require that we include more than one polyatomic ion in order to balance the positive and negative charges. To specify this, the polyatomic ion is put inside of parentheses and a subscript number is written after the parentheses to indicate the number of polyatomic ions present. So if we were making a compound between and , we’d need two nitrate ions to balance the charge, and the chemical formula would thus be written as .   Exercise 2:      Notice the pattern in the yellow and orange cells in the table above. What happens to the name and charge of the polyatomic ion as hydrogens are added?      Notice the pattern in the green and blue cells in the table above. What happens to the formula and charge when an -ate ending is change to -ite?      What would the correct formula be for the following ionic compounds. If you need multiple polyatomic ions, place parentheses around the ion and specify how many of them there are with a subscript after the parentheses.

You need to figure out the charge on the metal based on the identity and quantity of the non-metals and the quantity of the metal in the compound. Remember that the positive and negative charges need to balance.     Fe 3+     Fe 2+     Co 2+     Os 8+     Mn 3+     Sn 4+     Sb 5+        Name the ionic compounds in part 1.

For every hydrogen atom added, the charge increases by one (or the numeral decreases---ie. -3 to -2)      There is one less oxygen atom but everything else is the same.      What would the correct formula be for the following ionic compounds. If you need multiple polyatomic ions, place parentheses around the ion and specify how many of them there are with a subscript after the parentheses.

  "body": " Compounds 3   Making a covalent bond    Covalent compounds are formed when atoms share electrons. When two electrons are shared between two atoms, this forms a covalent bond . Covalent bonds are quite strong and are difficult to break. Thus covalent compounds remain together as discrete units called molecules , even when dissolved, melted, or boiled.  Before we discuss covalent compounds further, let’s learn rules that allow us to draw the Lewis dot structure for an atom:    Write the element symbol    Surround it with the valence electrons written as dots    There are 4 sides around the symbol (each side represents an outer shell atomic orbital-there is one outer s-orbital and 3 outer p-orbitals for most elements except hydrogen)    Place a maximum of 2 dots per side; don’t start pairing until you have to    Which side does NOT matter      How do covalent bonds form and how does sharing electrons help to hold together two atoms? Orbitals are most stable when they have completely filled (or completely empty orbitals). When two atoms come together, their atomic orbitals can combine together to form molecular orbitals . These molecular orbitals are shared between the two atoms and have shapes that resemble the s and p orbitals if they overlap with one another. Importantly, these are still orbitals, and thus molecular orbitals can still only hold 2 electrons.  Recall from earlier this chapter that the most stable electron configuration for most atoms is 8 valence electrons, because 8 electrons is the number required to completely fill the outer shell s (one of them) and p (three of them) orbitals. This is called the octet rule . So how can we fulfill the octet rule without adding or removing electrons?  We do this by forming molecular orbitals (which reduces the number of orbitals that have to be filled) and by sharing electrons between the atoms in these molecular orbitals. Consider the molecule . Each fluorine has 7 valence electrons, for a total of 14 valence electrons. Each fluorine also has a 4 outer shell orbitals, one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals, for a grand total of 8 outer shell orbitals. If two of those orbitals are combined into one molecular orbital, then the total number of outer shell orbitals is only 7. These 7 orbitals can be filled perfectly by the 14 electrons. Two of these electrons are shared between the two fluorine atoms in the molecular orbital and thus form the bond that links them together. See the figure below:    A screenshot of a video game AI-generated content may be incorrect.   The Lewis dot structures of 2 fluorine atoms are shown above. The circles are shown to emphasize the orbitals that the electrons are in. Note: normally a Lewis dot structure does NOT include these circles. In the bottom portion, the two fluorine atoms are joined together by a covalent bond. The red orbital is a molecular orbital that was created by fusing two atomic orbitals together. It contain electrons that came from both of the fluorine atoms.  Hydrogen is an important common exception to the octet rule. The nearest noble gas to hydrogen is helium, which has a completely filled 1 st shell that only requires two electrons. So hydrogen obeys the duet rule for valence electrons; it wants to have two valence electrons rather than 8.   Exercise 1:      Draw the Lewis dot structure for:      Hydrogen      Helium      Chlorine      Oxygen      Nitrogen      Carbon        Based on the number of valence electrons listed below, complete the “Typical number of bonds” column in the table below. Recall that atoms can essentially acquire an extra electron by having them shared with them through a bond.            Element  Number of valence electrons  Typical number of bonds in a Lewis structure    H  1     He  2     F  7     O  6     N  5     C  4     S  6     Ne  8       Lewis structures: Basic rules   When it comes to figuring out the structure of larger covalent molecules, the same principles apply (the octet rule, the duet rule, and combining atomic orbitals to form a shared molecular orbital). However, there are additional complexities that also get introduced. For instance, which atoms should be bound to which other atoms? Also, some atoms are capable of forming more than one bond. Carbon, for instance, has 4 valence electrons. That means that it needs 4 other electrons to be shared with it to reach its octet. That means that carbon likes to form 4 covalent bonds!  To help facilitate drawing Lewis structures, there are some basic procedural steps that you should follow. We’ll begin with the basic rules and then increase the complexity with more rules in later sections.   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:      Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)      Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!      Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining      Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!      More rules later…      Exercise 2:      How many valence electrons are in…                                     Draw Lewis dot structures for the following compounds                                                    Lewis structures: Multiple bonds   Try to draw the Lewis structure of (or see the figure below). If you follow the rules above, you quickly find that you have a problem, you can’t make an octet around each oxygen atom. How are we supposed to satisfy the octet rule, then?  We can satisfy the octet rule on both atoms by joining two additional atomic orbitals to form a second molecular orbital and by using this additional molecular orbital to share another pair of electrons. This creates a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. Each bond is a separate molecular orbital that contains a pair of shared electrons.  In some cases, such as when we try to draw the Lewis structure for , we need to join still another pair of atomic orbitals to form a third molecular orbital that we can use to share a third pair of electrons. This creates a triple bond.  The steps for drawing a Lewis structure can be added onto with an additional rule that covers these situations:   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:      Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)      Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!      Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining      Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!      If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2 nd bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!      Exercise 3:      Consider the drawing below that a student might make along the way to figuring out the Lewis structure of SeO. Explain how you know that the structure isn’t finished. Why can’t the student add more electrons to the structure?      Draw the Lewis structures of the following molecules. Keep in mind the number of bonds that each atom likes to form (from Exercise 1).

  "body": " Compounds 4   Section 1: Lewis structures: Formal charge   In many cases, a covalent compound will have atoms that are charged. Sometimes, multiple atoms in the structure will be charged, other times just a single atom. Sometimes the charges will cancel out (for instance if a structure has one atom with a +1 charge and another with a -1 charge), but in other cases they won’t (and we have a polyatomic ion). How then are we to figure out whether or not an atom in a structure is charged or not?  To figure out the formal charge on an atom in a Lewis structure, we apply the rules listed below:  Rules for formal charges:    If the atom is making its typical number of bonds, it DOES NOT have a formal charge    Atoms want to be surrounded by an octet (or duet) of electrons, but they don’t own all of them    Atoms own all of their lone pair electrons    Atoms own half of the electrons in the bonds connected to them      Atoms want to own their number of valence electrons    Charge=number of valence electrons desired-number of electrons owned in the structure    We can get clues from looking at a structure about what atom(s) are likely to have formal charges. Recall from an earlier exercise, how we can figure out the typical number of bonds that an atom will make (example: oxygen has 6 valence electrons so it needs 2 bonds to get to its octet). When an atom makes its typical number of bonds in a structure, that atom will typically have a charge of zero. If the atom is making a different number of bonds, then it is more likely to have a formal charge. You can use this to help you quickly narrow down which atoms are likely to have a charge in a structure. For example, oxygen atoms with 2 bonds almost always have a formal charge of zero. Oxygen atoms with one bond and 3 bonds are typically negatively and positively charged, respectively. (see the figure below)  Now that we know how to compute the formal charge on atoms in a Lewis structure, we should update our rules for Lewis structures with one additional step:   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:     Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)    Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!    Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining    Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!    If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2 nd bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!    Figure out the formal charge on the atoms (if any). List the formal charge next to the atom and circle it for emphasis     Exercise 1:      In the structure shown below (it’s NOT a correct structure at this point…), for each of the atoms, determine a) the number of electrons around the atom, b) the number of electrons that that each atom “owns”, c) the typical number of valence electrons for each atom, and d) the formal charge on each atom. NOTE THAT THE OXYGEN ATOMS HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF BONDS AND LONE-PAIRS OF ELECTRONS…SO ONCE YOU’VE FIGURED OUT ONE OF THEM, THE OTHERS ARE THE SAME…       A group of red text on a black background AI-generated content may be incorrect.      Add formal charges to the indicated atoms in the structures shown below            A blackboard with red writing on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.           A black background with red writing on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.           A group of red writing on a black background AI-generated content may be incorrect.       Draw the following Lewis dot structures and indicate which atom has the formal charge                                 Section 2: Lewis structures: Exceptions to the octet rule   Some atoms are capable of having more than an octet of electrons around them. Atoms in the 3 rd period of the periodic table and beyond are large enough that they can accommodate more electrons in their outer shell. In addition, they are not limited to just s and p orbitals; they also have d-orbitals which allow them to hold more than 8 electrons. To account for this, we have to add to some of our rules (highlighted in red) and also add an extra rule at the end.   Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:     Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens). Remember that atoms in the 3 rd period and below may be capable of making more than their typical number of bonds.    Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!    Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining    Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons! If you have extra electrons after giving every atom an octet, go ahead and place the additional electrons around an atom that’s from the 3 rd period or lower (usually the central atom in your structure).    If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2 nd bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!    Figure out the formal charge on the atoms (if any). List the formal charge next to the atom and circle it for emphasis    If the central atom is in the 3 rd period or lower, we have to check to see if it should make additional bonds and thereby break the octet rule. Try moving a lone pair from an outer atom and forming an additional bond to the center atom. Re-evaluate the formal charges. Repeat step 7 as needed. You are trying to…    Eliminate atoms with multiple charges (ie. +2 or -2)    Minimize the number of atoms with a charge    Prevent adjacent like-charges (ie. No negative charges on adjacent atoms…adjacent positive and negative charges can be okay)    Note: Usually the central atom will end up with a charge of 0       Exercise 2:      Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules:                                 Section 3: Structures of polyatomic ions   In this section, we’re not going to be adding any new knowledge. Instead, we’ll be tying your new skills to material that you’ve learned previously. Polyatomic ions are ions that consist of multiple atoms that are bound together through covalent bonds. In this section you’ll be determining the structure of polyatomic ions that we’ve previously covered and you’ll be determining which atom(s) in the structure contain the formal charges.

For now, we’ll limit our focus to binary (only two atom types) covalent compounds. We name binary diatomic compounds in a similar way that we name diatomic ionic compounds. We are going to name the first atom and then the second atom with its ending swapped for -ide. However, we also add on a prefix to both the first and second word that indicates how many atoms there are (with one exception). We have to do this because the atoms aren’t charged and thus we can’t figure out how many are present from the name alone. So what are these prefixes and what’s the exception? The prefixes are listed in the table below. The exception to adding prefixes is that we don’t add “mono-“ to the first word if there is only one.        Number  Prefix    1  mono (not used on the first word)    2  di    3  tri    4  tetra    5  penta    6  hexa    7  hepta    8  octa    9  nona    10  deca      Exercise 1:      What is the formula for the following compounds:      Carbon dioxide      Nitrogen trihydride      Disulfur dichloride      Triphosphorous pentafluoride        Name the following compounds                            Geometry   In chemistry, the shape of a molecule can be incredibly important. The shape of a pharmaceutical molecule allows it to properly interact with its biological target. The shape of a protein controls its function inside of a cell, allowing for things like metabolism and movement to occur. In order to understand the shape of complex molecules, we must first understand the shape\/geometry around a single atom within a covalent compound. Two or more electron groups are found around the atom whose geometry we’re considering. An electron group is defined as either a lone pair of electrons or an atom (or group of atoms) that is bound directly to the atom that we’re considering. If we know the number of electron groups, then we can determine the electron geometry using VSEPR theory. This theory states that the electron groups will spread out in 3D space as much as possible in order to maximize the distance between them. The electron geometries that we observe in molecules are dependent on the number of electron groups. If we have two electron groups around a central atom, then the best way for nature to separate them is to have them on completely opposite sides of the central atom. This creates a linear arrangement of our two electron groups and the central atom, and thus this electron geometry is called “linear” and has a bond angle of 180 degrees. If three electron groups are present, then they spread out in a flat triangular arrangement and the geometry is called “trigonal planar” and has bond angles of 120 degrees. With four electron groups, they must spread out in a 3D arrangement called “tetrahedral” with bond angles of 109.5 degrees (see the table below).  The electron geometry is useful information, but often we don’t care about where the lone pairs of electrons are and want to focus solely on the shape of the atoms in a molecule. When we’re figuring this out, we’re determining the molecular geometry (or molecular shape). The molecular geometries are determined by first figuring out the electron geometry. Once we’ve done this, we can ignore\/”cover-up” the electron groups that are lone-pairs of electrons, allowing us to focus on the ones that are groups of atoms. It’s important to note that the lone pairs of electrons are still present and still taking up space, but we’re simply choosing to ignore them. Thus if we have 3 electron groups around a central atom, but one of them is a lone pair of electrons, then the electron geometry is trigonal planar. If we cover up one of the electron groups, the resulting molecular geometry is called “bent” and it still has a bond angle of 120 degrees…the same as its electron geometry. If we have 4 electron groups, the electron geometry is tetrahedral and we have bond angles of 109.5 degrees. If one of the groups is a lone pair of electrons, then the molecular geometry has a non-flat triagonal molecular geometry called “trigonal pyramidal”. If two of the electron groups are lone pairs             Number of electron groups  Electron geometry  Electron geometry appearance  Bond angle  Number of lone pairs of electrons  Molecular shape  Molecular shape appearance    2  Linear   180 o  0  Linear     3  Trigonal planar   120 o  0  Trigonal planar         1  Bent     4  Tetrahedral   109.5 o  0  Tetrahedral         1  Trigonal pyramidal         2  Bent      In the diagrams shown, X represents the central atom. E is an electron group (either an atom or a lone pair of electrons). A represents another atom. Wedge bonds indicate that the bond is coming out of the paper at you. A dashed bond indicates that the bond is going away from you.   Exercise 2:      What are the electron geometries and molecular shapes described by the following:      2 electron groups, no lone pairs      3 electron groups, no lone pairs      4 electron groups, 1 lone pair of electrons      3 electron groups, 1 lone pair of electrons      4 electron groups, no lone pairs of electrons      4 electron groups, 2 lone pairs of electrons        Based on the Lewis structures below, determine the electron geometries, molecular shapes, and the bond angles.

O3 Lewis Structure - Chemistry Steps       What is the electron and molecular geometries in the following compounds? What are the bond angles?:      Carbon tetrachloride      Nitrogen trihydride      Carbonate      Sulfur dioxide        Polarity and intermolecular forces   When considering the types of bonding that are observed in chemistry, we use two distinct terms: ionic bonding and covalent bonding. In actuality, there are bonds that are somewhat in-between as well, where the electrons are being shared, but in a non-equal way. This results in one of the atoms having slightly more electrons than it should (producing a partial negative charge, depicted as ) and one having slightly fewer than it should (producing a partial positive charge, depicted as ). This type of bond is called a polar covalent bond because it has partial positive and negatively charged ends, or poles. A covalent bond where the electrons are shared equally is called a nonpolar covalent bond .  How can we figure out if electrons will be shared equally between two atoms? To determine this, we need to look at the electronegativity value of each of the bonded atoms. Electronegativity is a measure of how much an atom will attract additional electrons towards itself. The highest electronegativity value is fluorine, which will attract electrons the strongest. The lowest values are seen at the bottom left of the periodic table. See the chart in the link: Electronegativity chart . To determine if a bond is polar, we subtract the electronegativity values of the two bound atoms. If the difference is <0.5, then the electrons are shared more-or-less equally and the bond is non-polar. If the difference is 0.5-1.7 then the bond is a polar covalent bond, with the atom with the greater electronegativity value having the partial negative charge . If the difference is greater than 1.7, then the bond is likely an ionic bond.  A polar molecule is one that has a partially positive side and a partial negative side. If a molecule has polar covalent bonds then the molecule itself is often (but not always polar). The exception to this is when the polar covalent bonds cancel out one another due to a symmetric geometry. If the molecular geometry is either linear, trigonal planar, or tetrahedral (ie. one of the molecular geometries that doesn’t have a lone pair) AND the bonds are equivalent, then the polarities of the bonds will cancel out, resulting a case where we have polar bonds but a non-polar molecule. So in order to determine if a molecule is polar, we have to:    Ask if it has polar bonds    Make sure that the polar bonds don’t cancel each other out     How can polarity cancel out in a molecule?   There are two requirements:    The polar bonds must be equivalent in strength (generally they will be bonds between identical elements)    The polar bonds must be symmetric    Generally this means that the molecular shape must be tetrahedral, trigonal, planar, or linear    There cannot be lone pairs of electrons on the central atom      The polarity (or non-polarity) of a molecule determines how it is able to interact with other molecules. This is useful for understanding things like how DNA is held together, what gives proteins their shapes, how pharmaceuticals interact with proteins, etc. There are 4 types of intermolecular forces that we’re going to discuss: ionic bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and London dispersion forces. We’ve already learned about ionic bonds. This is the attraction between cations and anions that holds together ionic compounds. Basically any time we have a full positive or negative charge on an atom or a molecule, it will be able to interact with ionic bonds.  Dipole-dipole interactions are like ionic bonds in that a positive charge attracts a negative charge, but the distinguishing feature is that the charges are partial charges in this case. Polar molecules have partial positive and partial negative ends and are thus able to form dipole-dipole interactions with one another. This is why a polar molecule like sugar is able to interact with another polar molecule like water, allowing water to dissolve sugar.  Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when we have a polar N-H, O-H, or H-F bond that is able to interact with a lone pair of electrons. The hydrogen atom in each of the listed bonds has a partial positive charge. However, since hydrogen only has one electron, having it be partially positively charged is basically exposing a bare nucleus, allowing it to form bonds that are much stronger than other dipole-dipole interactions. The partially positively charged hydrogen atom is attracted to the partial negative charge of a lone-pair of electrons, forming a special type of dipole-dipole interaction (because of the exposed hydrogen nucleus) that we call a hydrogen bond.  London dispersion forces are the weakest of all of the intermolecular forces. They are a type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when temporary dipoles form. In every molecule the electrons are continually shifting. Sometimes this shifting\/movement of electrons creates a partial charge imbalance in the molecule, resulting in a partial negative and partial positive charge. These partial charges can attract those of adjacent molecules. Since these forces are dependent on the normal movement of electrons in any molecule, ALL molecules can interact with London dispersion forces. These forces are the reason why non-polar molecules can still interact with one another and simply don’t fly apart. Gasoline, for instance, is very non-polar but the molecules interact with one another strongly enough to hold together in a liquid form at room temperature.  In terms of strength, ionic bonds are the strongest due to the complete positive and negative charges. Hydrogen bonds are next, followed by dipole-dipole interactions. Last, in terms of strength, are London dispersion forces.   Intermolecular forces ordered according to strength:    Strongest     Ionic bonds    Ions are required    Example: Na+ and Cl-      Hydrogen bonds    A polar N-H, O-H, or F-H bond is required and a lone pair of electrons    Example:       Dipole-dipole interactions    A polar molecule is required    Example:       London dispersion forces    Applies to all molecules.

  "title": "Reactions 1",
  "body": " Reactions 1   Classes of chemical reactions   A chemical reaction is the process of converting one or more pure substances into others. In order to do this, nature does not create or destroy atoms (that only happens in nuclear reactions, as is covered in chapter 5). Instead, atoms are swapped between compounds. Bonds in the reactant compounds are broken and new bonds are formed to create the product compounds. See the example below:     In this example, compounds AX and BY are the reactants . AB and XY are the products of the reaction. Chemical reactions are always written with the reactants on the left, products on the right, and a reaction arrow separating them. In the example above, the bonds between A and X and B and Y are broken so that A can form a new bond with B and X with Y.  In chemical reactions, in addition to the chemical formulas of the reactants and products, we see additional numbers and symbols. See the example below:     In this example, the reactants H 2 and O 2 are reacting to form water (H 2 O). In front of the chemical formulas, there are sometimes additional numbers called coefficients . These numbers are used to tell how many of those elements or compounds are required for the reaction to be balanced (more on this in another lesson). After the formulas for the elements or compounds, it is quite common to see either (g), (l), (s), or (aq) listed. These symbols state whether the substance is a gas (g), liquid (l), or solid (s) or can indicate that the substance is dissolved in water (aq) (this stands for “aqueous”).  When learning about chemical reactions, it can be very helpful to classify the reactions. This allow us to begin to recognize patterns that we can use to predict what will happen in other chemical reactions. We’ll learn several different ways of classifying reactions, beginning in this exercise where we will classify reactions by the numbers of reactants\/products and whether the reactants\/products are elements or compounds. We’ll start with the simplest types of reactions:  Type 1: Addition reaction (sometimes called a combination reaction ): Two or more pure substances combine to make one. Example:     Type 2: Decomposition reaction : One substance breaks apart into two or more substances. Example:      An important note to be aware of: recall that some elements exist as diatomic compounds. This is very common with non-metals and they are typically gasses (with a few exaceptions) at room temperature. You need to know that the following elements exist as diatomic compounds:         Exercise 1:      Classify the following reactions as addition (combination) reactions or decomposition reactions:                  Write the following reactions using chemical formulas and coefficients. Indicate the state of the substance using the symbols learned above:      Two units of solid iron (III) hydroxide decompose into one unit of solid iron (III) oxide and three molecules of liquid water      Two units of solid silver bromide decay into two atoms of silver metal and one molecule of liquid bromine.      Two molecules of nitrogen gas combine with three molecules of hydrogen gas to produce two molecules of gasseous nitrogen trihydride        Slightly more complex reactions   Type 3: Single-replacement reaction : One compound reacts with a pure element. The element swaps with an atom in the compound. Example:     Type 4: Double-replacement reaction : Two compounds react with one another. Atoms from both compounds swap with one another. Example:     One common type of double-replacement reaction is a precipitation reaction. In a precipitation reaction, both reactants are ionic compounds that are dissolved in water (ie. aqueous, aq). When the reactants are combined, one of the combinations of a cation and an anion results in a compound that is insoluble in water, meaning that it cannot be dissolved by water. As a result, crystals of that insoluble ionic compound form in the reaction. Why are some ionic compounds soluble and others aren’t? Basically, in order for an ionic compound to dissolve in water, its ions must separate from one another and form new interactions with the polar water molecules (through ion-dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding). If the interactions that the ions form with water are stronger than the interactions holding the ionic compound together, then water will “win” and the ionic compound will dissolve. If the bonds holding the ionic compound together are stronger than the interactions that the ions can form with water, then the ionic compound “wins” and the ionic compound will not dissolve in water.  There are some rules about solubility of ionic compounds that you’ll need to know. You need to apply these rules in this order!    Compounds containing ammonium, magnesium, or alkali metal cations (group I metals), and\/or nitrate, and acetate anions are soluble    Compounds containing the cation of silver, lead, or mercury are insoluble    Compounds containing the chloride, bromide, or iodide anions are soluble    Compounds containing the sulfate anion are soluble, except when paired with group 2 metals    Everything else is insoluble     Exercise 2:      Predict whether the following compounds are soluble or insoluble in water.      Sodium phosphate      Potassium iodide      Silver bromide      Iron (III) carbonate      Magnesium sulfate      Copper (II) sulfate        Classify the following reactions are single replacement or double replacement:                            Will the following reactions produce a precipitate? If so, what is its name and chemical formula?      Aqueous sodium chloride and aqueous copper (II) nitrate      Aqueous sodium hydrogen phosphate and aqueous nickel (II) chloride      Ammonium sulfate and lead (II) nitrate      Strontium bromide and potassium sulfate        Ionic equations and Net Ionic equations   When the reactants in a reaction are aqueous, the standard way of writing a reaction works, but depending on what we’re trying to show, we can sometimes do better. For instance, writing NaCl (aq) in a reaction tells us that sodium chloride is dissolved in water. It doesn’t show us what has happened to the sodium chloride through. When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they dissociate into their ions, with both the cations and anions forming bonds with the dipole of water. A better way of depicting this in a chemical reaction would be to instead write NaCl (aq) as . This is what we do when we write an ionic equation ; all of the reactants and products that are aqueous are instead written as their ions that are dissolved in water. Two important notes:    If there is more than one ion, then this is specified with a coefficient in front of the ion…NOT with a subscript after it.    Polyatomic ions will not break apart    Both of these rules are illustrated when we write as .  A net ionic equation is an ionic equation that only lists the ions that actually react in the reaction. In order to write a net ionic equation we begin with an ionic equation and then delete any ions that are aqueous in both the reactants and products. These ions are called spectator ions because they don’t participate in the reaction themselves. See the example below:  Standard reaction equation:   Ionic equation:   Net ionic equation:    Exercise 3:      Write ionic and net ionic equations for the following reactions                            Key:    E1:        Addition      Decomposition                           E2:        soluble      soluble      insoluble      insoluble      insoluble      soluble        Classify the following reactions are single replacement or double replacement:      Double replacement      Double replacement      Single replacement      Single replacement        Will the following reactions produce a precipitate? If so, what is its name and chemical formula?      No precipitate      yes, nickel (II) hydrogen phosphate ( )      yes lead (II) sulfate,       yes, strontium sulfate,         E3:      Write ionic and net ionic equations for the following reactions      Ionic equation:          Net ionic:        Ionic equation:        Net ionic:        Ionic equation:        Net ionic:        Ionic equation:        Net ionic:     "

  "body": " Reactions 2    Oxidation-Reduction reactions   Another way of classifying reactions is by ones that result in a transfer of electrons from one substance to another, regardless of the number of reactants or products involved. These reactions that involve a transfer of electrons are known as oxidation-reduction reactions (also called redox reactions ). In a redox reaction, one or more reactants will take electrons from one or more other reactants. If a reactant gained electrons then it got reduced . If a reactant loses electrons, then it gets oxidized. This can be remembered by the saying “LeO the lion says GeR”…Losing electrons is oxidation, gaining electrons is reduction. A slight amount of confusion enters in when we talk about oxidizing agents and reducing agents . These agents are causing the oxidation or reduction of some other substance, respectively. Therefore an oxidizing agent will cause the oxidation of something else (ie. cause something else to lose electrons). It can only do this by accepting the electrons itself. Therefore an oxidizing agent gets reduced in a chemical reaction. The opposite is true of reducing agents . A reducing agent causes the reduction of another substance (ie. causes something else to gain electrons) by providing the electrons itself. Therefore reducing agents get oxidized in chemical reactions.  When dealing with ionic compounds in a reaction, it is straightforward to determine if a redox reaction is occurring. All we need to do is look at the charge on the ion. A very important note: elements have a charge of zero when in their elemental form . So in the zinc has a +2 charge and the chlorines each have a charge of zero. Let’s investigate the following reaction:     In this case the zinc begins with a charge of +2. In the products, it is in its elemental form and thus has a charge of zero. How did the zinc change charge??? It gained two electrons! The negative charge of the two electrons cancels out the +2 charge, resulting in neutral zinc. Thus the zinc gained electrons and got reduced. In every redox reaction, something gets reduced and something gets oxidized. So in the example above, what is losing electrons? The chloride has a -1 charge in zinc chloride and still has a -1 charge in sodium chloride, so the chloride isn’t participating in the electron transfer. The sodium, on the other hand, begins in its elemental form with a charge of zero and then has a charge of +1 in the products. So the sodium is losing electrons. Each sodium loses one electron, but there are two sodium atoms present, so this adds up to 2 electrons being lost by the sodiums (which matches the two electrons being gained by the zinc; the number of electrons lost must always equal the number of electrons gained in the reaction).  When gets turned into , hydrogen gas (with its two electrons) is released. Therefore, the reactant got oxidized to . We can recognize this because the carbon in the reactant lost a bond to hydrogen and gained a new bond to oxygen, indicating that it got oxidized. In this reaction the two hydrogen atoms that were lost from gained those two electrons and thus got reduced.      One special class of redox reaction involving covalent compounds is a combustion reaction . In a combustion reaction, a carbon containing compound reacts with oxygen gas ( ), producing carbon dioxide ( ) and water ( ). Combustion reactions are carried out when we burn fossil fuels in our cars or in power plants. The reaction releases a lot of energy that can be harnessed for beneficial purposes. It is also very important to note that our bodies carry out combustion reactions when we break down sugars, fats, and proteins to get harvest energy. The chemical equation showing the breakdown of glucose is shown below:     It is a combustion reaction because a carbon compound reacts with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide and water. Also, the carbon atoms in the glucose compound end up losing bonds to hydrogen and gaining bonds to oxygen, indicating that they are getting oxidized. The oxygen atoms are losing a bond to the other oxygen and gaining new bonds to hydrogen and are thus getting reduced.   Exercise 1:      For the following redox reactions, identify the substance being oxidized and the substance being reduced. Identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent. How many electrons are being transferred in each reaction?                  For the following reactions (note: these are the reactions that you wrote ionic and net ionic equations for in exercise 3…looking at those equations may help you!) identify whether they are redox reactions or not. If they are redox reactions, identify what is being oxidized and what is being reduced.                            In the following redox reactions, identify the species that is getting oxidized and the species that is getting reduced.       A black arrow pointing to a black arrow AI-generated content may be incorrect.       A black arrow pointing to a black arrow AI-generated content may be incorrect.        In the combustion of hexane ( ), one of the reactants is hexane. What are the other reactants and what are the products? (don’t worry about how many of each should be in the reaction)      Which reactant gets oxidized? Which one gets reduced? Which is the oxidizing agent? Which is the reducing agent?        Balancing chemical reactions   In chemical reactions, the law of conservation of mass applies. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed by chemical reactions. The consequence of this law is that when writing chemical reactions, we need to make sure that the number of each type of atom in the reaction is the same on both sides of the reaction arrow. So if there are three nitrogen atoms in the reactants, then the products side must have 3 nitrogen atoms as well. What if the numbers of atoms are not balanced? We cannot change the number of atoms in the compounds without changing the identity of that compound (ie. do NOT change the subscripts). We have to balance the reaction by adding in coefficients in front of the compounds. To do this, we’re going to follow the following steps that will work for any simple reaction (we won’t deal with more complex reaction in this class):    Write the reaction with the correct chemical formulas of the reactants and products    Determine the number of atoms of each element on the reactants and products sides    If all of the elements are balanced, then you’re done      Select one element that appears in only one compound in both the reactants and the products. Balance it by adding in necessary coefficients in front of the compounds. Then check to see if the elements are balanced    Repeat step 3 with other elements that only appear in one compound in both the reactants and product.    Balance any remaining elements by changing\/adding coefficients    Check and recheck every element for balance    Simplify the coefficients    If you have any fractional coefficients, multiply ALL of the coefficients by numbers found in the denominators    If all of the coefficients have a common factor (ex. 4, 8, and 2 all have a common factor of 2), then divide them all by that common factor      To see these steps in practice, see the example below:  Example: Balance the combustion reaction for .    Since this is a combustion reaction, we know the other reactants ( ) and products ( and ) so the reaction is     Check to see if the atoms are balanced on both sides of the reaction:           Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  1    H  4  2    O  2  3      They aren’t, so we have to go to step 3.     We should balance either hydrogen or carbon first because they are only found in one compound in the reactants and products. Oxygen is found in two spots in the products and is thus harder to balance. Lets start with carbon. We need to have two carbons on the right side, so lets as a coefficient of 2 in front of the carbon dioxide as shown:              Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  2    H  4  2    O  2  5     Notice that the number of oxygens in the products also changed…changing coefficients often changes the amount of numerous atoms.    Now that carbon is balanced, let’s balance hydrogen. We need to increase the number of hydrogens on the right side. Adding a coefficient of 2 in front of the water will give us 4 hydrogens since each of the two water molecules has 2 hydrogens:                Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  2    H  4  4    O  2  6       We can now move on to oxygen. There are 6 on the right and 2 on the left. We can fix this by adding a 3 as a coefficient in front of the oxygen gas.              Element  Number on left side  Number on the right side    C  2  2    H  4  4    O  6  6       All of the elements are balanced and the coefficients are simplified. We are now done.     Exercise 2:      Balance the following reactions by adding in the necessary coefficients:                                Write an equation for the following reactions and balance it    Aqueous sodium sulfate and aqueous calcium chloride are mixed    Combustion of        Moles   In chemistry, we often have to deal with very large numbers of things (ex. atoms or molecules). For convenience, we can rely of scientific notation to help us out. We can also use the term mole to help us out. A mole is a word that represents a number of things (similar to how a dozen means 12 things). The number represented by a mole is Avogadro’s number and has a value of . Why this weird number? You’ll have to wait until the next section of this lesson to find out. We can use the definition of a mole as a conversion factor to convert between numbers of things (atoms\/molecules\/etc.) and moles:       When carrying out calculations involving numbers of molecules and\/or atoms, it is VERY important to add labels to our units to specify what is being quantified. This can help us see if we need to use other conversion factors in our problems. See the example below.  How many molecules are in 3.0 moles of water? How many hydrogen atoms are in 3.0 moles of water?    We begin with 3.0 moles of water and want to determine the number of molecules of water. To do this we need to use Avogadro’s number as shown below:         To convert from molecules of water to number of hydrogen atoms, we need to see that 1 water molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms. This can be written as a conversion factor and used to solve the problem as shown:        Hint to try and understand moles:   When faced with confusing concepts in chemistry, like a mole, it can sometimes be helpful to think of more familiar examples with simpler numbers. Recall that a mole is like a dozen; it is a word that represents a number.  If you have 2 dozen eggs, how many do you have? 24 of course. How did you get that? You took the 2 and multiplied it by the number represented by a dozen (12).  So if you have 2 moles of molecules, you’ll follow the same pattern: 2 times the number represented by a mole (6.022 x 10 23 ).  Likewise if I have 48 eggs, how many dozen do I have? 4 dozen. You get this by taking the number of objects and dividing by the number represented by a dozen.  So…how would you determine how many moles of molecules you have if you have 432 molecules? Take that number and divide it by the number represented by a mole.     How many molecules are in 0.366 moles of carbon dioxide? How many carbon atoms? How many atoms? How many protons?      If you have   hydrogen atoms, then how many moles of atoms do you have. If those hydrogen atoms are in the form of  , then how many molecules of   do you have? How many moles of H 2 molecules do you have?      If 3.0 moles of carbon dioxide are mixed with 4.5 moles of water, how many moles of oxygen atoms are there? How many atoms of oxygen?

  "body": " Reactions 3    Molar Mass and its use in chemistry   We’ve previously learned about atomic mass. Recall that it’s the average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotopes weighted according to their abundance. The value of the atomic mass can be found in the periodic table under the element symbol. By adding together the atomic masses of all of the elements in a compound, we can determine the molecular weight (for covalent compounds) or formula weight (for all compounds) of the compound in units of amu. Molecular weight and formula weight are calculated in the same way, but they apply to different compounds; molecular weight only applies to molecules (which only exist in covalent compounds) whereas formula weight applies to both ionic and covalent compounds. Molar mass is the mass of one mole of the compound. It has the same value as the formula weight and is calculated in the exact same way, but it has different units of grams per mole (g\/mol) instead of amu. Thus a single carbon atom has an atomic mass of 12.011 amu, and a mole of carbon atoms will weigh 12.011 g. This is the reason for the bizarre value of Avogadro’s number…it’s the number of atoms needed to give an atom the same weight in grams as its atomic mass in atomic mass units.  So we can find the molar mass of an element from the periodic table by taking the atomic mass and appending units of g\/mol to it. If we can do this, then we can also figure out the molar mass of entire compounds by simply adding together the molar masses of each of the component elements.   Molar mass is used as a conversion factor to convert between grams and moles and vice-versa. When coupled with Avogadro’s number, we can convert between grams and numbers of things (like molecules). This is summed up in the diagram shown below.   Exercise 1:      What is the molar mass of the following compounds?      Chlorine gas      Magnesium chloride      NaCl      CH 4      Magnesium nitrate        If you have 42.3 g of chlorine gas, how many moles of chlorine gas do you have?      How much does 0.375 moles of NaCl weigh in grams?      How many chlorine atoms are in 5.73 mg of magnesium chloride?      What is the mass of 3.33 x 10 17 hydrogen atoms in nanograms?      Mole-mole relationships in chemical reactions   We just learned how to convert between moles and numbers of atoms\/molecules. When we’re talking about chemical reactions, it is often very useful to be able to convert between moles of one substance in the reaction and moles of another. This allows chemists to determine how much reactant is needed for a reaction to proceed or to determine how much product can be produced. To do these calculations, we NEED to have a balanced chemical reaction. If one is not provided as a part of a question, then you need to make sure to write one.  The balanced chemical reaction is key because the coefficients in front of the chemical formulas will be used to determine a conversion factor called a mole-mole ratio. For instance, the mock formula: implies that for every 2 moles of A, the reaction would require one mole of B and then produce 3 moles of C. We can write these relationships as conversion factors:     Which one we choose is determined by which information we’re given and what information we’re trying to attain. See the example and helpful hint below:  For the reaction below: if we have 3.0 moles of aluminum chloride, then a) how many moles of sodium hydroxide would be needed to completely react with the aluminum chloride and b) assuming that we have an excess of sodium hydroxide, how many moles of aluminum hydroxide could be produced?                 Helpful hint:  It can be helpful to think of more obvious examples of ‘reactions’ that we are familiar with in our everyday lives. The problem solving strategies that you employ can be similarly used in chemistry problem solving. For instance, we all know that a tricycle has 3 wheels. If I have 6 wheels, how many tricycles can I make? The answer is hopefully easy for you to determine…we can make 2 tricycles with 6 wheels. How did you solve this and could you instead use dimensional analysis and a balanced reaction to solve it?  Balanced reaction:   Conversion factor:   Math with the conversion factor:     Write three mole-mole conversion factors based on the reaction shown below:         If you have 17 moles of S 8 , how many moles of oxygen gas are required to completely react with it? If you have that much oxygen gas, then how many moles of sulfur trioxide can you possibly form?    You are carrying out the reaction of iron metal plus chlorine gas to produce iron (III) chloride. If you require 6 moles of iron (III) chloride, how many moles of iron and how many moles of chlorine gas would you need?    Write a balanced chemical equation for this reaction    Figure out the mole-mole conversion factors that you need and solve       Theoretical yield in chemical reactions   In a chemical reaction, it is often surprising to students that the mass of the reactants does not match up with the mass of the products. The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass of all of the reactants must equal the mass of all of the products, but the masses of individual reactants or products often differ. For instance, in the reaction if we start with 2 grams of hydrogen gas (and excess oxygen gas), we don’t get a mass of 2 grams of water; we get about 18 grams of water! Don’t the coefficients from the balanced reaction mean that for every 2 grams of hydrogen gas, we should get 2 grams of water?! No. The coefficients only apply when we’re counting things (numbers of molecules or moles of molecules); they do NOT apply to mass. Why not? The reason is that different molecules have different masses. We can illustrate this with a relatable example:  For the reaction, , if each tire weighs 40 pounds, would you expect the car to weigh only 160 pounds? No. The reason is that the car frame adds mass. The car will have the mass of those tires, but also extra mass from the frame. Similarly, water has added mass from oxygen and thus the 2 grams of hydrogen gas end up producing a larger mass of water.   The previous section allows us to determine the number of moles of product that can be produced in a chemical reaction if we are given the number of moles of reactants. In a laboratory setting, we don’t have any tool that allows us to measure the number of moles of a reactant directly. Instead, we are able to determine the amount of reactants and products by measuring their mass. As we learned in the last lesson, we can easily convert between grams and moles using the molar mass of a substance. So if we are given a certain number of grams of reactant, we can determine the number of moles of that reactant. We can then convert that number of moles to moles of product using the balanced chemical reaction and the mole-mole conversion factor. Finally, we can convert between the number of moles of product and the number of grams of product by using the molar mass of that product. This procedure is summarized in the diagram below:   Exercise 3:      For the reaction shown below, if you have 5.0 grams of S 8 and an unlimited amount of oxygen gas, how many grams of sulfur trioxide could you theoretically form?           For the reaction shown above, how many grams of oxygen gas would be required to react with 5.0 grams of S 8 ?      For the reaction of potassium hydroxide with iron (II) chloride, how many grams of iron (II) hydroxide could form from 3.00 moles of potassium hydroxide and an unlimited amount of iron (II) chloride?      For the reaction in #3, how many grams of iron (II) hydroxide could form from 3.0 grams of potassium hydroxide and an unlimited amount of iron (II) chloride?

  "body": " Reactions 4    Reaction energetics: kinetics and thermodynamics   In chemistry, it is often very helpful to know how fast reactions occur. Within our bodies, chemical reactions drive a wide range of different processes ranging from DNA replication, to movement, to nerve firing. Each of these processes must be carefully controlled. For instance, a nerve firing too quickly could disrupt muscle contractions leading to seizures or cardiac arrest. So in chemistry, what controls the speed of a reaction? The answer is that both the speed and extent of a reaction are controlled by the energetics of that reaction. Some reactions that we regard as impossible (ex. helium, a noble gas, reacting with oxygen) aren’t actually impossible…they’d just require a LOT of energy in order to make them occur. Energy similarly controls the speed of a chemical reaction.  How are we to understand the energetics of chemical reactions? Reaction energy diagrams can be very useful in this. A reaction energy diagram displays the energy level of the reactants and products of a reaction as well as the energy of the transition state. The transition state is a point that is midway between reactants and products. In most chemical reactions, bonds have to be broken before new bonds can form. The transition state generally represents a point at which the old bonds have been broken and the atoms are positioned so that new bonds can form (see the figure below that depicts the formation of water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas).  Reaction energy diagrams, like the one shown below, depict the difference between the energy level of the reactants and the transition state, a quantity known as the activation energy of the reaction. Activation energy is directly proportional to the speed or kinetics of a reaction. The higher the activation energy, the slower the reaction; the lower the activation energy, the faster the reaction. This is because as the activation energy of a reaction increases, it becomes less and less probable that a given reactant molecule will have enough energy to transform from reactants into products. The less likely this is, the slower the reaction proceeds. Reactions can be sped up by adding in more energy (ie. by increasing the temperature) or by adding in catalysts . A catalyst is a substance that is able to speed up a reaction by decreasing the energy of the transition state. Importantly, a catalyst does this without being consumed by the reaction. A catalyst also does not affect the energies of the reactants or products.  Reaction energy diagrams also depict the relative energies of the reactants and products. The relationship between the reactants and products will determine which one is favored in the reaction, with nature always favoring the one that has the lowest energy (ie. the one that is the most stable). Reactions where the products are lower in energy than the reactants are called exergonic reactions . These reactions will proceed in the forward direction and will release energy. Reactions where the reactants are lower in energy than the products are called endergonic reactions. In those reactions, the reaction would tend to proceed in the reverse direction, creating more reactants from the products. In order to get the reaction to proceed in the forward direction, energy would have to be put into the reaction, often by applying heat. This is similar to how you have to expend energy to push an object uphill. It is important to understand that whether a reaction is exergonic or endergonic predicts the directionality of a reaction and whether or not there will be more reactants or products when the reaction finishes. It does NOT determine how fast a reaction occurs; that is only determined by the activation energy.   Sample reaction energy diagrams:            Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions in our bodies. Enzymes are not used up in chemical reactions. Thus enzymes are acting as __________ in the chemical reactions that they carryout.    Draw a reaction energy diagram that is exergonic. Label the reactants and products and transition state and mark the activation energy on the diagram.    Draw a second diagram on top of this one that has the same reactants and products but that would occur faster      Draw a reaction energy diagram that is neither exergonic or endergonic. Label the reactants and products and transition state and mark the activation energy on the diagram.    What would you expect the relative amounts of reactants and products to be at the conclusion of this reaction?      Draw a reaction energy diagram where the reactants would almost entirely be converted to products, but where the reaction is also extremely slow.    If we add heat to a reaction, the speed of the reaction will _____________(increase\/decrease)     Reaction equilibrium and Le Chatelier’s principle   Our discussion of reaction energy diagrams and energetics revealed that chemical reactions are reversible. Chemical reactions, once started proceed both in the forward and reverse directions, however it’s often the case that one direction is preferred over the other. For the purposes of this discussion, let’s assume that the forward direction is preferred over the reverse direction (ie. the reaction is exergonic). The net reaction initially proceeds in the forward direction because the forward reaction is occurring faster than the reverse reaction. However, as time goes on, the reactants begin to run out, slowing down the forward reaction, while the reverse reaction begins to speed up. The reaction finally stops once it reaches equilibrium. At this point, the amount of reactants and products is no longer changing because the speed of the forward reaction is equal to the speed of the reverse reaction. Once reactions reach equilibrium, the net reaction can once again proceed (either in the forward or reverse direction) if the equilibrium is disturbed. We can predict the outcome of this disturbance by applying Le Chatelier’s principle . Le Chatelier’s principle states that a reaction at equilibrium will respond to changes by trying to restore the equilibrium. This can be easily illustrated by viewing chemical reactions as a seesaw. A reaction at equilibrium can be thought of as a balanced seesaw; once a disturbance occurs, then the balance of the seesaw is broken. In order to restore the equilibrium, reactants must either convert to products or products must convert to reactants until the balance is once again restored.   Progress of a reaction towards equilibrium :    A useful model for understanding Le Chatelier’s Principle:          For a given chemical reaction, if the forward reaction has a rate of 4 and the reverse reaction has a rate of 6, then what is the direction and net rate of the reaction?      What will happen to the forward and reverse rates as the reaction approaches equilibrium?        Consider the following reaction that has reached equilibrium:         Which direction would you expect the net reaction to proceed in if:      Sodium chloride is added to the reaction      The precipitate is removed from the reaction      The reaction is cooled      The reaction is heated      Sodium hydroxide is added to the reaction      Calcium chloride is added to the reaction        In chemical manufacturing, in order to maximize the amount of product formed, the product is often removed from the reaction as the reaction proceeds. Why does this help?

The forward rate will speed up as reactants are created        Consider the following reaction that has reached equilibrium:         Which direction would you expect the net reaction to proceed in if:      Toward reactants (reverse)      Towards products (forward)      Towards products (forward)      Towards reactants (reverse)      Towards products (forward)      Towards products (forward)        Removing product causes the reaction to shift towards products by Le Chatelier’s principle     "

  "body": " Gases 1    Kinetic molecular theory of gases and pressure   Gases are a state of matter. Gases are similar to liquids in that they adopt the shape of their containers, but are different in that they will spread out to occupy the entire volume of their container. Thus gases do NOT have a fixed volume or a fixed shape. To better understand these properties as well as other properties of gases that we’ll be learning abou in this chapter, scientists have developed the kinetic molecular theory of gases. This theory states that the properties of a gas can be understood by a model that assumes the following:    Gases consist of tiny particles that occupy only a small percentage of the total volume of the gas    The gas molecules are constantly moving with very high speeds    Gas molecules do not interact with one another at all due to their high speeds and the fact that they occupy such a small percentage of the volume of the gas    When gas molecules impact one another or the sides of their container, they bounce off, essentially losing none of their energy.    The average speed of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature. So as temperature increases, the gas molecules move more quickly.    This information about gases will help us to understand other properties of gases as well as the gas laws that we’ll encounter later in the chapter. The first such property that we can begin to discuss is pressure. When a gas is near a surface (like air near our bodies) or trapped in a container, then the gas molecules will impact the surfaces that they’re exposed to with a certain amount of force. This force will push against that surface. When a force is being applied to a surface, we can measure the pressure being exerted. Pressure is simply the amount of force being applied divided by the area of the surface that it’s being applied to. This can be illustrated easily using everyday objects. If you place a large piece of wood on top of another piece of wood and hit it with a hammer, you’re unlikely to drive one piece of wood into the other. However if you place a nail on a piece of wood and hit it with a hammer, you can easily drive the nail into the wood. Why? The amount of force applied with the hammer was the exact same. However, in the first case, the amount of surface that the force was applied to was large, meaning that the pressure was small. In the case of the nail, that same amount of force is applied to the narrow point of a nail (a much smaller area) so the nail has a very high pressure and is able to easily penetrate the wood.  The idea of gas pressure is actually quite fascinating when you think about it. We know that we can inflate balloons by filling them with a gas and that this gas exerts a certain amount of pressure (that we can easily feel if you try and squeeze the balloon). The bizarre thing about the balloon, though, is that the ballon is almost entirely empty. What keeps it inflated isn’t that it is ‘full of air’, it’s that the little bit of air inside is impacting the balloon surface with such force that it’s continually driving it outwards, keeping it inflated. In fact, each gas molecule inside of a helium balloon at room temperature is impacting the surface of the balloon with a speed of approximately 4000 miles per hour!!!  We can measure the pressure of a gas using various units. The SI unit for pressure is a Pascal (Pa), and like other SI units we can attach metric prefixes to it. Other units of pressure are commonly used also. These include atmospheres (atm), bars, inches (or millimeters) of mercury, and pounds per square inch. If you ever need to convert between these various units on an exam, a conversion factor will be provided.   Exercise 1:      If you increase the temperature of a gas      Do the molecules move faster or slower?      Would the molecules impact the sides of the container with more force or less force?      If the sides of the container remain the same size and surface area, would this cause the pressure to increase or decrease?        Calculate the pressure if 10.0 pounds of force are applied to an object with a surface area of 2 square inches (answer in units of pounds per square inch).      Calculate the pressure if 10.0 pounds of force are applied to an object with a surface area of 0.5 square inches (answer in units of pounds per square inch). Is this pressure higher or lower?        Convert 1.72 atm of pressure to the following units using the conversion factors provided:      Pa (1 atm=101,325 Pa)      kPa      pound per square inch (psi) (14.7 psi=1atm)      bar (1 atm=101,325 Pa and 1 bar=100,000 Pa)        Basic gas laws   The kinetic molecular theory of gases can give rise to our understanding of three basic gas laws: Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and Gay-Lussac’s Law. These laws relate changes in pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas. Each law also has an associated equation that can be used to determine the effect of changing the pressure, volume, or temperature of a gas.  Boyle’s law states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional to one another if the temperature is kept constant. This means that as one goes up, the other must go down (ex. if the volume decreases then the pressure must increase). We can understand this quite easily if we reflect on the kinetic molecular theory of gases. If gas molecules are moving around with a certain speed, because the temperature is kept constant, and we shrink the container that the gas is trapped in, then the gas molecules will be impacting the walls of the container more frequently and thus the pressure exerted will increase. Most of us have probably experienced Boyle’s law if you’ve ever tried to squeeze a balloon. When you do that, you are attempting to reduce the volume of the gas, and as you do so, it gets harder and harder to squeeze. Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, this can be described mathematically as where c is a constant (the value of this constant isn’t important and actually varies depending on a number of factors). With that equation, if we increase pressure, then volume must decrease in order for the product to still equal c. This relationship hold true as long and the amount of gas and the temperature are kept constant…so under one set of conditions and under a second set of pressure and volumes . Since both of these equations equal c, we can set them equal to one another to get the equation for Boyle’s law:     This equation can be used to determine the new pressure of a gas if the volume changes or to find the new volume if the pressure changes (again, assuming that the temperature and the amount of the gas are fixed).  Charles’s law relates the volume and temperature of a gas, stating that these two properties are directly proportional (assuming that the pressure and amount of gas are constant). This again agrees with kinetic molecular theory because if I increase the temperature of a gas, the molecules will move faster, this would cause them to impact the sides of the container with more force, thus increasing the pressure. If the pressure is being held constant, however, the only way to allow for this is to have the volume of the gas increase, causing the impacts of the gas on the sides of the container to become less frequent. Thus an increase in temperature causes an increase in volume and a decrease in temperature would cause a decrease in volume. Many of us have also seen Charles’s law in our lives. Charles’s law is used to inflate hot air balloons; the heat from the flame at the base of the balloon heats the gas inside causing the volume of the balloon to increase and inflate. This relationship can be described mathematically by where c is a constant. Like in Boyle’s law, this equation will hold under different conditions, so we can similarly derive the equation for Charle’s law:      It is VERY important to note that this equation only works if the temperatures have units of Kelvin!!!! Using this equation we can predict the new volume of a gas if the temperature changes or the new temperature if the volume changes (assuming that the amount of gas and the pressure are constant)  The final law that we’ll cover in this section is Gay-Lussac’s Law. This law states that pressure and temperature are directly proportional if the volume and amount of gas are fixed. Gay-Lussac’s law can be understood if we realize that increasing the temperature causes the speed of molecules to increase. If the size of the container is kept the same, then those molecules will impact the sides with more force, thus increasing the pressure. Gay-Lussac’s law can be described with the formula:     This equation can be used to find the new pressure if the temperature of a gas changes or the new temperature if the pressure changes (again, assuming that the volume and amount of gas don’t change).   Exercise 2:      Proportionality      For this exercise, we are going to examine an example of inverse proportionality using the equation  , where a and b are the variables that are inversely proportional, and c is a constant. If a= 80 and b=20, then what does c equal?      If a doubles to 160, what is the new value of b (remember that c is the same as in the previous problem because it’s a constant). Does b increase or decrease? Does b decrease by the same amount as a or by the same factor (ie. does it increase by 80 or does it double also)?      If b decreases to ¼ of its original value, then what happens to a? Does a increase by the same amount as b or by the same factor as b?        For this exercise, we are going to examine an example of direct proportionality using the equation  , where a and b are the variables that are directly proportional and c is a constant. If a= 80 and b=20, then what does c equal?      If a doubles to 160, what is the new value of b (remember that c is the same as in the previous problem because it’s a constant). Does b increase or decrease? Does b increase by the same amount as a or by the same factor (ie. does it increase by 80 or does it double also)?      If b decreases to ¼ of its original value, then what happens to a? Does a decrease by the same amount as b or by the same factor as b?          Boyle’s law (for the following problems, assume that the temperature and amount of gas do NOT change)      If a gas has a pressure of 740 kPa and a volume of 23 L, what is the new pressure if the volume is decreased to 17 L?      If a gas has a pressure of 740 kPa and a volume of 23 L, what is the new volume if the pressure is decreased to 110 kPa?      If a gas has a pressure of 740 kPa and a volume of 23 L, what is the new volume if the pressure is decreased to 110 Pa?        Charles’s Law (for the following problems, assume that the pressure and amount of gas do NOT change)      If a gas has a volume of 22.1 L and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new volume of the gas if the temperature is increased to 761K?      If a gas has a volume of 22.1 L and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new temperature of the gas if the volume is increased to 77.1 L      If a gas has a volume of 22.1 L and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new temperature of the gas if the volume is decreased to 77.1 mL?      If a gas has a volume of 73.5 mL at a temperature of 32 o C, then what is the new volume if the temperature decreases to -15 o C.      Calculate this correctly, then calculate it without converting the temperatures to Kelvin. When you leave the temperatures in Celsius, what obvious problem do you notice?          Gay-Lussac’s law (for the following problems, assume that the volume and amount of gas do NOT change)      If a gas has a pressure of 73.2 psi and a temperature of 73.1 o C, what is the new pressure of the gas if the temperature doubles to 146.2 o C?      Did the pressure double when the temperature, measured in Celsius, doubled?        If a gas has a pressure of 73.2 psi and a temperature of 73.1K, what is the new pressure of the gas if the temperature doubles to 146.2 K?      Did the pressure double when the temperature, measured in Kelvin, doubled?        If a gas has a pressure of 2.3 atm and a temperature of 731 K, what is the new temperature of the gas if the pressure is changed to 2.3 kPa (1 atm=101.325 kPa)?

  "body": " Gases 2    Combined gas law   Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, volume and temperature are directly proportional, and pressure and temperature are directly proportional, we can describe these three relationships with the equation . Since this relationship should hold under multiple conditions (assuming that the amount of gas doesn’t change), we can derive the combined gas law:      Exercise 1:      Combined gas law (the following problems assume that the amount of gas doesn’t change)      If a gas has a pressure of 17.0 atm, a volume of 1.05 L and a temperature of 302 K, what is…      the new pressure if the volume is decreased to 0.55 L and the temperature is increased to 331 K?      the new volume if the pressure is increased to 34.0 atm and the temperature decreases to 151 K?      the new temperature if the pressure increases to 33.5 atm and the volume increases to 7.55 L        If a gas has a pressure of 1.52 MPa, a volume of 223 L and a temperature of 151 o C, what is the new temperature if the pressure decreases to 453 kPa and the volume increases to 1.55 kL?        Avogadro’s law and molar volume   All of the gas laws that we learned about in the last lesson allowed for changes in the pressure, volume, and\/or temperature of the gas. All of those laws had the stated assumption that the amount of the gas was fixed. Avogadro’s law is the first law that allows us to predict the effect of changing the amount of gas. Avogadro’s law relates the volume of a gas to the number of moles of the gas. It states that the volume of the gas and the number of moles are directly proportional to one another if pressure and temperature are kept constant. This means that if the number of moles of a gas increase, then the volume would be expected to increase as well. A real-world example of this is what happens when you blow into a balloon. You are increasing the amount of gas in the balloon and, as a result, its volume increases. Like our other gas laws, this proportionality can be shown by an equation: where n is the number of moles of gas and c is a constant. If we want to predict the effect of changing the amount of gas on the volume, then we can use the form of Avogadro’s law shown below:     One consequence of Avogadro’s law is that one mole of a gas will always have the same volume, regardless of which gas we’re talking about, if the pressure and temperature are kept constant. At a standard temperature and pressure (STP, defined as 1 atm of pressure and 273.15 K) one mole of gas has a volume of 22.4 L. This is called the molar volume of a gas. Molar volume can be used as a conversion factor ( ) to convert between volume and number of moles if the gas is at STP conditions.   Exercise 2:      If you have a 22.2 L ballon of gas containing 0.0311 moles of helium, what will the new volume be is an additional 0.0233 moles of helium are added?      If you have a 34.2 L sample of oxygen gas at STP, how many moles of oxygen gas do you have?      What is the volume of 17.0 g of oxygen gas at STP? Hint: what information do we need to go from grams to moles of oxygen gas?      A 10.0L balloon has a contains 3.2 grams of helium gas. If 1.6 grams of helium gas is added, then what is the new volume? Hint: what information do we need to go from grams to moles of helium gas?      Ideal gas law   Avogadro’s law and the other gas laws can all be combined together. Pressure and volume are inversely proportional. Temperature and moles of gas are directly proportional to volume. If we combine all of this information, we get the equation:     where c is a constant. In chemistry, we substitute the symbol R for this constant to give:     R is a special constant in chemistry called the ideal gas constant. There are several different values for R which are all actually equivalent…they have different values because they have different units of pressure or volume. The value of R that uses SI units of pressure and volume is . The equation shown above is called the Ideal Gas Law and is often shown in the rearranged form:     The other laws that we learned about are useful for predicting the effect of changing the conditions of a gas, either the pressure, volume, temperature, or moles of gas. The Ideal Gas Law allows us to calculate one unknown property of a gas if we’re given the other 3 properties. For instance, if we know the pressure, volume, and temperature of a sample of gas, we can calculate the number of moles of gas.  Various values for R:                 If a sample of gas contains 0.0300 moles of gas and has a pressure of 2300 Pa at a temperature of 273K, what would the volume of the gas be?      Calculate the temperature of a gas if 3.0 moles of gas have a volume of 43L and a pressure of 2.3 atm. (1atm=101325 Pa)      What is the pressure of a gas in units of MPa if 2.3 moles of gas are placed into a 6.7L container at 103 o C?         Key:    Exercise 1:      Combined gas law (the following problems assume that the amount of gas doesn’t change)      If a gas has a pressure of 17.0 atm, a volume of 1.05 L and a temperature of 302 K, what is…      36 atm      0.263 L      4280 K        879K        Exercise 2:      38.8L      1.53 moles      11.9 L      15 L      Exercise 3:      30.

The Ideal Gas Law can be used to determine the number of moles of reactants or to determine the pressure\/volume\/temperature of the products from the number of moles. This is displayed in the figure below. Also, please see the sample calculation shown below.    A diagram of a chemical process Description automatically generated    Sample calculations:   A vessel with a volume of 1200 L contains 17 kg of nitrogen gas and exactly the amount of hydrogen gas needed to react with it at a temperature of 500.0 o C. The nitrogen and hydrogen gas react according to the equation shown below:       How much hydrogen (in moles) is needed to react with the nitrogen gas?    What is the starting pressure of the gases in the tank in units of psi?    (     What is the pressure in the tank at the conclusion of the reaction in units of psi?     Solutions:     We need to go from kg of nitrogen gas to moles of nitrogen gas using the molar mass, then to moles of hydrogen gas using the mole-mole conversion factor.            We are going to use the Ideal Gas Law and plug in the total number of moles of nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas.               We can borrow information from part a. If we have moles of nitrogen gas, we can use a mole-mole conversion factor to get the number of moles of NH 3 . We can then use the Ideal Gas Law to calculate the pressure.                 Exercise 1:      When our bodies ‘burn’ glucose ( , they do so according to the following reaction:         If a person consumes a soda with 42 g of glucose, what volume of carbon dioxide will they emit at STP once they’ve burned all that glucose?      Water can undergo an electrolysis reaction shown below:         If 33 g of water undergoes this reaction in a sealed chamber with a volume of 2.0 L at a temperature of 301K, then what will the pressure be in the chamber at the end of the reaction in MPa?    Partial Pressures and Dalton’s Law   All of the gas laws that we’ve dealt with thus far assume that we are dealing with a pure sample of one gas. What is we’re dealing with a mixture of gases, like air? If we have a mixture of gases in a container, then we can measure the volume of the mixture and its temperature and those values will apply to each of the individual gases within the mixture as well, because each of the individual gases will occupy the entirety of the volume and have the same amount of kinetic energy as all of the other gases in the mixture. However, the gas particles of an individual gas in a mixture of gases will NOT have the same pressure as the mixture. This is because each individual gas is impacting the sides of the container with only a portion of the total pressure being exerted by the mixture itself. We have a term for the amount of pressure that an individual gas exerts within a mixture and it is called the partial pressure of that gas.   Dalton’s Law deals with the partial pressure of gases within a mixture, and it’s an intuitive law when you think about it. Daltons law says the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases that make up the mixture. This is because each individual gas impacts the sides of the container with a certain force. The total force is simply the sum of the forces of each of the gases. Since they are all impacting the same surface area, the pressures should also be additive. Dalton’s Law is summarized by the following formula:      Exercise 2:      If the partial pressure of gas A is 34 psi and the partial pressure of gas B is 44 psi in the same container, what is the combined pressure of the gases?      If a mixture of gases has a pressure of 4.0 atm, and it contains 3 gases. Gas A has a partial pressure of 2.7 atm, gas B has a partial pressure of 0.4 atm. What is the partial pressure of gas C?

  "body": " Gases 4    Henry’s Law and Breathing    Henry’s Law is our last gas law. It deals with solubility. Solubility is the amount of a material that can be dissolved into another; in this case, we’re talking about how much gas can dissolve in water. Henry’s law states that the solubility of a gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure. If the partial pressure of a gas is increased, it can press its way into the liquid more easily, and thus more of that gas dissolves.  Now we’re going to do some practice problems dealing with gas laws and breathing.      Exercise 1:      The lungs inflate and deflate because of the action of a muscle called the diaphragm. This muscle causes the lung volume to expand and contract.      If the volume of the lungs increases, what happens to the air pressure inside of the lungs? Which law dictates this?      If the volume of the lungs decreases, what happens to the air pressure inside of the lungs?      Air will spontaneously move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. For a and b above, which corresponds to inhaling, and which corresponds to exhaling?        In our lungs our cells are exposed to air that has a high partial pressure of oxygen gas. Would the solubility of oxygen in our blood in the lungs be high or low?      When blood travels through our peripheral tissues, the amount of oxygen gas decreases because it gets taken up by our tissues. This __________(decreases\/increases) the partial pressure of oxygen that the blood is exposed to and thus ___________(increases\/decreases) the solubility of oxygen in the blood. Explain how this makes it easier for muscles to obtain oxygen from the bloodstream.      Carbon dioxide is made in our peripheral tissues and is only a small component of our atmosphere. As a result the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is __________(high\/low) in our peripheral tissues, meaning that its solubility in our blood is ______ (high\/low). When blood travels to the lungs, due to the low amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, its partial pressure is ____(high\/low). This _______(increases\/decreases) the solubility of carbon dioxide in the blood, allowing it to be eliminated from the body.      Which Equation do I Need??   Each of the problems that you’ve done thus far is within a single section of the chapter, making it relatively easy to figure out what equation to use. On an exam, the problems are not organized in such a straightforward manner, and it falls on you to figure out which one(s) you need to use. Here are some tips:    In the problem, is something about the gas changing (pressure, volume, moles, temperature)? If so, then you want to use an equation with the subscript 1’s and 2’s…Boyle’s, Charles’s, Gay-Lussac’s, Combined Gas Law, Avogadro’s Law.    Are you trying to find a missing parameter about the gas, but nothing is changing…probably need the Ideal Gas Law.    Is your problem dealing with a reaction or mass of the gas? If so, you probably need to change to moles (using either molar mass or the Ideal Gas Law)    Partial pressures or gas mixtures? Then think Dalton’s Law    Find an equation that has the parameters that are provided and the one that you want. (if you are given a starting pressure and temperature of a gas, and the pressure is changed and you’re being asked for temperature, then Gay-Lussac’s should be used because it has only pressure and temperature in the equation)     Exercise 2:      If you have 2.0 grams of argon gas in a 25L balloon, what will the new volume be if 3.0 grams of argon gas is added. Assume that the temperature and pressure do NOT change.      If a gas has a pressure of 2.1 atm and a volume of 3.3 L, what will the new pressure be if the volume is expanded to 5.7 L?      A gas at 271 K, 3.3 atm of pressure, and with a volume of 5.4 L is heated to 299K at the same time that its volume is decrease to 1.7 L. What is the new pressure?      3.5 grams of gaseous water vapor is at a temperature of 452K in a volume of 150mL. What is the pressure of this gas in MPa?      2.5 moles of gas A completely reacts to form gases B and C according to the reaction below. The reaction takes place in a 15L vessel at 522K.           What is the pressure in units of Pa at the beginning of the reaction in MPa?      What is the partial pressure of B in the vessel at the end of the reaction in MPa?      What is the total pressure in the vessel at the end of the reaction in MPa?     Key:   Exercise 1:        Pressure decreases, Boyle’s law      Pressure increases, Boyle’s law      A is inhaling, B is exhaling        High solubility of oxygen      Decreases, decreases. Since the blood has a lower solubility of oxygen due to Henry’s Law, this causes even more oxygen to leave the blood for the tissues to use, ultimately removing almost all of the oxygen from the blood for use by tissues in the body.      High, high, low, decreases      Exercise 2:      63 L      1.2 atm      12 atm      4.9 MPa        0.72 MPa      0.36 MPa      1.4 MPa       "

  "body": " Solutions 1    Solutions with covalent vs. ionic compounds   When we dissolve one substance into another to make a homogeneous mixture, we’ve made a solution . The substance that there is less of is called the solute and the substance that there is more of is called the solvent . When discussing preparing a solution, we generally state that the solute is dissolved in the solvent (ex. sodium chloride is dissolved into water—the sodium chloride is the solute and water is the solvent). For the most part in this course, we’re going to be considering cases where water is the solvent.  Some compounds are capable of dissolving in water, whereas others cannot. Why is it that some compounds are able to dissolve in water and others are not? There are a few considerations that we need to take into account to completely answer this question. Ultimately, though, a compound will dissolve if the bonds that the compound forms with water are stronger than the bonds that the compound and water both had in their previous state.  To understand this, we must first understand what happens when a compound does successfully dissolve in water. If the compound is an ionic compound, then the compound will break apart into its individual ions as we’ve learned previously . Each of these ions will form new bonds with the polar water molecules that surround them. Recall that if a molecule is polar, that it has a partially negatively charged end and a partially positively charged end. Thus the partially negatively charged end of water is attracted to cations from the ionic compound and the partially positively charged end of water is attracted to anions from the ionic compound. These types of interactions are called ion-dipole  interactions . Covalent compounds, on the other hand, do NOT break apart when dissolved in water. Instead the covalent compound separates from other identical molecules and forms new bonds with water using the intermolecular forces we learned about previously (dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding, and London dispersion forces).  Now that we understand what has to happen to dissolve a compound, let’s draw some parallels to reaction energy diagrams that we’ve learned about in Chapter 7. We saw that we can indicate the energy levels of the reactants and products, and that the transition state separates them. The same is true for a dissolving ‘reaction’ (we usually don’t actually consider this to be a reaction since no new compound forms). In order for our starting compounds (reactants) to dissolve in one another (products), bonds must be broken (transition state) so new bonds can form. If the energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants, then the compound will dissolve because the dissolved state is more stable than the starting point. If the energy of the starting compound and water is lower than the energy of them dissolved together, then the compound will not dissolve because the undissolved state is more stable.   Exercise 1:      Will the following compounds break apart into ions or remain intact when dissolved in water?                KBr                       Draw a reaction energy diagram for      A compound that will dissolve      A compound that won’t dissolve        What types of intermolecular forces would hold together the following covalent molecules?                  In the previous problem if you try to dissolve the compound in part a into water (part b)…      What new types of bonds would form between the compound in a and the compound in part b?      What types of bonds would you have to break (hint: think about 3a and 3b)      Draw a reaction energy diagram showing what would happen. (If you have to break strong bonds, then you go up a large amount to reach the transition state, but a small amount for weak bonds. If you form strong bonds, then you descend a large amount from the transition state, but for weak bonds then you only descend a small amount).      Based on this diagram, would this compound dissolve or not?        Was the compound is 3a polar or non-polar? Is water polar or non-polar? Do you think polar or non-polar covalent compounds are more likely to dissolve in water? Why?        Solubility and temperature effects    Solubility is the a term that describes the amount of one compound that can dissolve into water. For instance, at 20 degrees Celsius, the solubility of NaCl is approximately 35g\/100g water. This means that 100 g of water can dissolve up to 38 g of sodium chloride. If we try to dissolve 17 g of sodium chloride into 100 g of water, it will dissolve, forming a solution. We could still dissolve more sodium chloride into that solution because it is not yet saturated. A saturated solution is one where the maximum possible amount of solute has dissolved into water. In the example above where we tried to dissolve 17g of sodium chloride into 100 g of water, it was easy to determine that it wasn’t saturated because 17g NaCl\/100g water is clearly less than the solubility of 35g NaCl\/100g water since the amount of water is the same. However, could we dissolve 17.5 g of NaCl into 43 g of water??? To determine this we want to convert this ratio into one that has 100 g of water in it, allowing us to compare it to the solubility of NaCl in water. We do this as shown below:          Since 40.7 g is more than the solubility of 35g of NaCl in 100 g of water, this amount of sodium chloride would not completely dissolve and we’d end up with a saturated solution with some undissolved solid sodium chloride left over.  Changing the temperature often has an impact on how much of a compound can dissolve in water. The effect differs depending on whether the compound that is being dissolved is a solid or a gas. For most solids, the solubility of a solid increases as the temperature increases. Thus we can dissolve more solute at higher temperatures. If a saturated solution is prepared at high temperatures and the temperature is then decreased, we can end up in a situation where we have more solid dissolved in water than the solubility limit allows for and this is called a supersaturated solution . These solutions are unstable and will spontaneously eject solid from the solution causing it to crystallize and reform the solid.   The solubility of gases, on the other hand, decreases with increasing temperature . As the temperature rises, less gas can remain dissolved in water. This is part of the reason why opened soda remains carbonated in the refrigerator but rapidly goes flat if kept warm.   Exercise 2:      If the solubility of sodium nitrate is 88 g sodium nitrate\/100 g water, then would it be possible to dissolve the following?      75 g sodium nitrate in 100 g water      95 g sodium nitrate in 100 g water      44 g sodium nitrate in 50 g water      57 g sodium nitrate in 72 g water      5 g sodium nitrate in 9 g water        The solubility listed above is the solubility of sodium nitrate at 20 degrees Celsius. At 80 degrees Celsius the solubility of sodium nitrate is 148 g sodium nitrate\/100 g water.      How many grams of sodium nitrate could dissolve in 40.0 g of water at 80 degrees Celsius?      How many grams of sodium nitrate could dissolve in 40.0 g of water at 20 degrees Celsius      If you prepared the saturated solution in part a and then cooled it to 20 degrees Celsius, how much solid sodium nitrate would you expect to crystalize?

  "body": " Solutions 2    Measuring concentration with percent composition   When dealing with solutions, it is often very important to know how much solute is dissolved into a certain amount of volume of the solution. This quantity is called the concentration of the solution. We have several different ways of expressing concentration. The first way that we’ll learn about is percent composition. There are three different forms of percent composition, mass-mass percent composition (% m\/m), mass-volume percent composition (% m\/v), and volume-volume percent composition (% v\/v). The formulas for each is shown below:     with units of % m\/m     with units of % m\/v     with units of % v\/v    When calculating a percent composition, we simply have to use the formulas above, but we must make sure that the units that we’re using match the units in the formula…if they don’t we need to do some unit conversions first.  We can also use percent composition to figure out how much solute is dissolved in a certain volume (or mass) of solution as shown below:  How many grams of mL of ethanol are in a 250mL bottle that contains a 65% v\/v solution?    Create a conversion factor using the percent composition. Since the values are percents, the bottom will always have a value of 100:         Use dimensional analysis:          Exercise 3:      Calculate the mass-mass percent for the following solutions      3 g NaCl dissolved in 55 g solution      3g NaCl dissolved in 44 g of water (note that this is NOT the grams of solution!)      0.30kg of ethanol dissolved in 4300 g of solution        Calculate the mass-volume percent for the following solutions      3 g NaCl dissolved in 45 mL of solution      175 mg NaCl dissolved in 5.0 mL of solution        Calculate the volume-volume percent for the following solutions      32 mL of ethanol dissolved in 100 mL of solution      165 µL of ethanol dissolved in 2.50 mL of solution        How many grams of NaCl are in 35 mL of a 1.0 % m\/v solution?      How many moles of NaCl are in 1.0L of a 2.0 % m\/v solution?      Molarity   Chemists often use a different unit of concentration because it’s often helpful to know the number of moles of solute dissolved in solution (because knowing the number of moles is critical if we’re doing any calculations involving chemical reactions). This unit of concentration is molarity . Molarity has a symbol of capital M, which is a shorthand abbreviation for moles\/L. Thus a 3.0 M solution of sodium chloride has 3.0 moles of sodium chloride dissolved in 1 L of solution. This can be expressed as the following formula:     Thus, if 1.5 moles of solute is dissolved in 0.50 L of solution, the molarity is . We can also append the metric prefixes on molarity (ex. mM). The prefix pertains to the number of moles of solute. So mM means .  Using molarity as a conversion factor:  How many grams of sodium hydroxide are contained in a 150 mL of a 500.0 mM solution of sodium hydroxide.    Convert volume and molarity to their base units. Volume should be in liters and we want to remove prefixes from molarity            Write molarity as a conversion factor:           Use molarity to determine the number of moles of solute:         Convert from moles to grams with the molar mass        Exercise 4:      Calculate the molarity of the following solutions:      0.15 moles of NaCl dissolved in 0.37 L of solution      0.070 moles of NaCl dissolved in 175 mL of solution      17 g of NaCl dissolved in 570 mL of solution        How many moles of sodium chloride are needed to prepare 45 mL of a 3.0M solution?      How many grams of sodium chloride are needed to prepare 45 mL of a 3.0 M solution?      How many mg of sodium chloride are contained in 1.00 mL of a 175 mM solution of sodium chloride?     Key:   Exercise 3:      Calculate the mass-mass percent for the following solutions      5% m\/m      6% m\/m      7.0 % m\/m        Calculate the mass-volume percent for the following solutions      7% m\/v      3.5 % m\/v        Calculate the volume-volume percent for the following solutions      32% v\/v      6.60% v\/v        0.35 g      0.34 moles      Exercise 4:      Calculate the molarity of the following solutions:      0.41M      0.40 M      0.51 M        0.14 moles      7.9g      10.2 mg     "

Equivalents is a way of measuring the amount of charge in a sample of chemical. Equivalents can be calculated as follows:     So if you have 2 moles of sulfate ions, then you have of sulfate. We can speak about the equivalents of a single ion or about the equivalents from a compound. If we are concerned about an ionic compound, then we calculate the equivalents of charge for each of the ions and then add them together. See the example below:  Calculate the number of equivalents in 2 moles of potassium sulfate.    Figure out the chemical formula if not provided         Figure out the number of moles and charge for each of the ions                  Solve for the number of Eq of both ions then add them together:             If 5.0g of potassium phosphate is dissolved into 150mL of water, what is the concentration of potassium phosphate in mEq\/L.    Figure out the formula for the compound         Convert from grams to moles         Calculate the charge and moles of each ion            Calculate the Eq of each ion and then add them together               Convert from Eq to mEq         Convert from mL to L         Divide mEq by L        Exercise 1:      How many Eq of K + do you have if you have 0.150 moles of KCl      How many Eq of oxide are in 2.0 moles of       Calculate the number of mEq of calcium ions in 0.050 moles of       How many mEq of magnesium chloride in 0.077 L of 0.110 M magnesium chloride      If 0.011 moles of sodium carbonate is dissolved in 0.28 L of water, what is the concentration of the sodium carbonate in mEq\/L?      Calculate the concentration of sodium chloride in mEq\/L if 0.15 g is dissolved into 750mL      Dilution calculations   It is common for solutions to become diluted in science and medicine. Dilution is what happens when more solvent is added to an existing solution. The solute amount remains the same, but the amount of solvent increases, and thus the concentration of the solute in the new solution is lower than it was previously. When dilutions occur, it is helpful to be able to determine what the new concentration of the final solution will be. Likewise, if you are trying to use dilution to prepare a solution with a desired concentration, then you need to know how much of the original solution and solvent you should mix. To aid in these calculations we have the following formula:     The C’s are concentration and the V’s are volume. C 1 and V 1 represent the concentration of the starting solution and the volume of it that was diluted. C 2 and V 2 represent the concentration of the final diluted solution and the volume of the final diluted solution. The units on the volumes can be any volume units, as long as the units of V 1 and V 2 are the same. Likewise, the units on C 1 and C 2 can be any concentration unit, as long as the units are the same.   Exercise 2:      17mL of 2.0M sodium chloride is diluted to a final volume of 350mL. What is the concentration of the diluted solution?      28 mL of 2.0 % m\/v sodium hydroxide is diluted to a final volume of 2.0L. What is the concentration of the diluted solution?      75 mL of 150.0 mg\/mL aspirin is mixed with 155mL of water. What is the new concentration?      You are trying to prepare 3.0L of 0.050M NaOH by diluting a 2.0M solution of NaOH. How many liters of 2.0M NaOH do you need to dilute?      You are trying to prepare 3.0L of 15mM NaOH by diluting a 1.0M solution of NaOH. How many liters of 1.0M NaOH do you need to dilute? How many liters of water will you need to add to that? Don’t worry about significant figures for this problem.     Key:   Exercise 1:      0.150 Eq      4.0 Eq      100 mEq      34mEq      160 mEq\/L      6.8 mEq\/L      Exercise 2:      0.097M      0.028% m\/v      49 mg\/mL      0.075 L      0.045 L of 1M NaOH needs to be mixed with 2.955 L of water.

  "body": " Solutions 4e    Molarity in reactions   We can do chemical reactions using reactants that are dissolved in solution. We’ve learned one example of this previously when we learned about precipitation reactions. In our next chapter, we will learn about acid-base reactions which often take place in solution as well. Because of this, it is important to be able to carry out calculations involving these reactions. Solution reactions are particularly important because of titrations , chemical reactions that are carried out to measure the amount (or concentration) of a molecule or ion in a solution. Titrations are very useful in chemistry, allowing chemists to measure the quantities such as the amount of pollutants in drinking water.  Thankfully, carrying out these sorts of calculations proceeds in a similar way as other reaction calculations that we’ve done previously. The difference is in the start point and end point. Instead of starting off with a mass of reactant, we will start off with a molarity and volume. We can use this information to calculate the number of moles of the reactant using dimensional analysis or the formula below:      Once we know the number of moles of reactant, we can change this to moles of another reactant or moles of product by using a mole-mole conversion factor derived from the balanced chemical equation. From there, the number of moles of that substance can be converted to mass using the molar mass or to molarity using the volume. See the figure and example below.  Example. If 23.5mL of 0.988 M NaOH is needed to neutralize (fully react with) 7.50 mL of HCl, then what is the molarity of that HCl solution?       We have molarity and volume of one component in a reaction and are being asked for the molarity of the other reactant. The first step is to figure out moles of NaOH.    Molarity x Liters= moles. Our volume is in mL. We need to convert this to L before using it:                We need to convert from moles of NaOH to moles of HCl using a mole-mole conversion factor         Molarity=moles\/Liters. We need to first change our volume to L, then use the equation.           Exercise 3:      Consider the reaction below. If 10.0 mL of 0.125 M lead (II) nitrate reacts with an excess of NaCl, how many g of lead (II) chloride would you expect?           Consider the reaction below. If 4.75 mL of 0.0500 M NaOH is needed to neutralize (completely react) with 20.00 mL of HCl, then what is the molarity of the HCl solution?           Consider the reaction below. If 27.75 mL of 0.1200 M NaOH is needed to neutralize (completely react) with 20.00 mL of  , then what is the molarity of the  solution?           A sample of water is contaminated with lead (II) nitrate. 10.0 L of the water is mixed with an excess of NaCl to precipitate the lead as lead (II) chloride according to the reaction below. 0.0751 g of lead (II) chloride is obtained. What was the concentration of the lead (II) nitrate in the water sample in units of µM?           3.5 L of 0.050 M iron (III) chloride reacts with an excess of sodium carbonate. How many grams of precipitate would you expect?      Osmosis and dialysis   If two solutions (or one solution and a pure solvent) are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then dialysis and osmosis can occur. What is a semi-permeable membrane? It is a membrane that has very tiny holes in it that of a certain size. This allows very small molecules and ions to travel across the membrane (ex. water, small covalent molecules like glucose, and soluble salts can cross the membrane) while larger molecules and objects can’t (ex. proteins and blood cells cannot cross because they can’t fit through the tiny holes). Diffusion is a term that describes the movement of molecules in a solution. In diffusion, molecules generally move from an area with a high concentration to an area with low concentration.  Dialysis is a term that describes the diffusion of solute molecules across a semipermeable membrane from the side with a high concentration to an area with a low concentration. Osmosis describes the movement of water (the solvent) across the semi-permeable membrane, and will be discussed in a little bit.  As stated above, solute will move via diffusion from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This will continue until the concentrations are the same on both sides of the membrane. So if two solutions, one containing 1.0 M NaCl and the other containing 0.50 M NaCl are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then the NaCl will move from the side with 1.0M NaCl towards the side with 0.50M NaCl. If both sides have the same volume , then this will continue until the concentration on both sides is the average of the two starting concentrations, 0.75M NaCl (IMPORTANT NOTE: this is only the case if the volumes are the same on both sides of the membrane. In this class, we will not do the more complex calculations where the volumes are different on both sides of the membrane).  Osmosis is similar to dialysis, but it describes the movement of the solvent (water) instead of the solute. Similar to dialysis, osmosis is governed by diffusion and water will move from an area with a high concentration of water to a low concentration of water. Why am I emphasizing that the movement depends on the concentration of water? This is because concentrations usually focus on the concentration of the solute, rather than the solvent. How are we supposed to figure out the concentration of the water then? We can qualitatively determine the relative concentration by keeping in mind this rule: the concentration of solute and the concentration of solvent are inversely proportional…meaning that if the concentration of solute is high, then the concentration of solvent is low. Why is this? It’s because if there is a lot of solute, then it is taking up space in the solution that would otherwise have been occupied by solvent…thus there is less solvent in the same amount of space.  In osmosis, water will flow from the side with a low solute concentration to the side with a high solute concentration, because that is the same as saying that the water is flowing from the side with a high water concentration to the side with a low water concentration. So if two solutions, one containing 1.0 M NaCl and the other containing 0.50 M NaCl are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then the water will move from the side with 0.5 M NaCl towards the side with 1.0M NaCl, the opposite direction of the solute movement. The water pressing up against the membrane as it tries to cross applies a force to the membrane called osmotic pressure . In extreme cases, this pressure can be so strong that it causes the semi-permeable membrane to break.  Our body’s cells are surrounded by a semi-permeable cell membrane. Thus dialysis and osmosis are important considerations in medicine. This is particularly true when administering fluids directly into the bloodstream (ex. IV fluids). Doctors and nurses need to make sure that the osmotic pressure of the fluid being administered balances the osmotic pressure inside of the patient’s cells. Solutions where the osmotic pressure is balanced with the pressure inside of a cell are called isotonic solutions. Two common isotonic solutions used in medicine are 0.9% m\/v sodium chloride and 5% w\/v glucose. Solutions that contain too little solute (and thus a higher than normal concentration of water) are called hypotonic solutions . These solutions will cause water to rush into cells, causing them to swell and, in severe cases, to burst. If the concentration of solute is higher than normal, then the solution is a hypertonic solution. If a hypertonic solution is administered, water will move out of blood cells, causing them to shrink and wrinkle in appearance, a phenomenon called crenation.  In medicine, blood dialysis is used when a patient has non-functional kidneys. Our kidneys normally filter toxins from our blood stream and help to maintain ion and water balance. When the kidneys don’t work, then the blood must be filtered artificially. In blood dialysis, the patient’s blood is removed from their body and passed over a semi-permeable membrane. On the other side of the membrane is an isotonic solution that is free from the toxins that are found in blood. The semipermeable membrane prevents large proteins and blood cells from leaving the blood. The toxins in the blood, however, can cross the membrane and flow from the area with high concentration (the blood) to the area with low concentration (the dialysis fluid on the other side of the membrane), thus eliminating them from the patient’s body.   Exercise 4:      Chamber A contains 2L of 3.0 M glucose and Chamber B contains 2L of 1.0 M glucose. These chambers are separated by a semipermeable membrane.      Which direction (A to B or B to A) will glucose flow?      What is this called?        Which direction will water flow?      What is this called        What will the final concentration of glucose be in both chambers?        Classify the following solutions as isotonic, hypertonic, or hypotonic with respect to blood      3% m\/v glucose      1.5 % m\/v NaCl      0.9 % m\/v NaCl      3.0 g of glucose dissolved in 75 mL of water        Let’s assume that a patient’s body contains 6.0L of blood and that their blood contains 150 µM of a particular toxin. If their blood is dialyzed against 6.0L of isotonic fluid, then what will the concentration of toxin be after the dialysis?      The dialysis is immediately repeated using a new batch of the isotonic fluid. What is the new concentration of toxin in the patient’s blood?      What if it is repeated a third time?

  "body": " Acids and Bases 1   What is an acid\/base?   There are multiple definitions of acids and bases which all generally say the same things, but with different ways of looking at it. These definitions are summarized in the table below:         Name  Definition of an acid  Definition of a base    Arrhenius definition  Produces H +  Produces OH -    Brønstead-Lowry definition  Donates H +  Accepts H +     Compounds like HCl are acids because they are ionic compounds and when we place them into water, the ions will dissociate producing H + and Cl - . Because HCl produces H + in water, it fits the definition of an Arrhenius acid. However, H + doesn’t exist for very long in water. It rapidly reacts with water to product hydronium ion , H 3 O + . Thus the HCl actually donated an H + to water in this reaction, fitting the Brønstead-Lowry definition of an acid             Green letters on a black background Description automatically generated   Sodium hydroxide fits the definition of a base. When it is dissolved in water, it quickly dissociates into ions, Na + and OH - . As a result, it fits the definition of an Arrhenius base since the concentration of hydroxide increases. It also fits the definition of a Brønstead-Lowry base, but this takes a bit more effort to see. This is because the hydroxide that is produced can accept a H + forming water.           Acids and bases don’t just react with water, they can be mixed allowing them to react with one another. In these cases, often the Brønstead-Lowry definition is easier to use to identify an acid from a base. Consider the reaction shown below:     In this reaction, the NH 3 (ammonia) accepts an H + from CH 3 CO 2 H (acetic acid). Thus ammonia is acting as a base and acetic acid is an acid because it donates an H + .  What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH 4 not an acid while HCl is? Hold that question for now. It will be discussed more in the conjugate acids and bases section later in this lesson.   Exercise 1:      Identify the acid and base in the following reactions                     C is the reverse reaction of B. The nitrogen containing compound in b was a\/an _______(acid\/base). In the reverse reaction, the nitrogen compound was a\/an ______(acid\/base). Explain why this makes sense                       Compare your answers in E and F, focusing on water. What interesting property does water possess?          Draw the Lewis structure of hydronium ion.      Naming acids and bases   We already know how to name the common bases that we’ll see in this chapter. Most of the bases we’ll be discussing are ionic compounds that contain the hydroxide ion. We’ll be naming those compounds in the same way that we’ve named them in the past. There is one additional base that we’ll frequently encounter in this chapter, NH 3 , which is called ammonia (you should learn this). We’ll learn about other nitrogen containing bases in later chapters as well as how to name them.  Naming acids follows different rules than we’ve used previously. When naming acids, it depends on if the acid is 1) composed of two elements, 2) contains a polyatomic ion, or 3) is an organic acid (more on these in a later chapter). Acids that contain only two elements include HCl, HBr, and HI. For these acids, we name them by starting with the name of the anion (ex. HCl—we start with chloride). We then drop the -ide ending and replace it with “-ic acid”. Lastly we add “hydro-“ as a prefix. So, HCl is hydrochloric acid.  If the acid contains a polyatomic ion, then we name the anion and drop the -ate ending from the name (we won’t worry about polyatomic ions with other endings). We then add on “ic-acid” and in some cases instead add “-uric acid” or “-oric acid” (if the name of the polyatomic ion ends in an “f” sound; ex. -fate or -phate).  Additionally, some acids are polyprotic acids, meaning that they have more than one H+ that can be donated to a base. Phosphoric acid, for example, is the acid produced from the phosphate ion, . The acid thus must have 3 H + added to fully neutralize the 3 - charge, giving the formula H 3 PO 4 . Previously, we learned that there are other forms of the phosphate anion that has one or two H + s added on. and are called hydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate respectively. These are also acids since they have one or more H + s to donate, but since they are also polyatomic ions, their name is simply the name of the polyatomic ion.  To figure out the formula for an acid, we need to know the anion that it is paired with, both its formula and its charge. We then only need to pair it with the appropriate number of H + ions in order to have the number of positive and negative charges be equal.   Exercise 2:      What is the name of the following acids?      HBr      HI      HNO 3      H 3 PO 4      H 2 SO 4             What is the name of the following bases?      KOH      Sr(OH) 2      NH 3            is listed as an acid in problem 1g and a base in problem 2d. How can it be both?          What is the correct chemical formula for the following acids or bases?      Calcium hydroxide      Carbonic acid      Acetic acid      Hydrochloric acid      Magnesium hydroxide      Cesium hydroxide        What is the correct acid name if H + is added to the following polyatomic ions to turn them into acids:      Citrate      Aspartate      Oxalate        Strengths of acids and bases   When an acid or base is dissolved into water, the compound dissociates into ions (or produces ions in other cases). This process can be written as a chemical reaction. See the example below:     In a previous chapter, we learned that all chemical reactions are reversible and we learned about equilibrium. The same is true for the dissociation of an acid or base in water. Some of these dissociation reactions have equilibriums that lie so far towards the products that they are nearly irreversible reactions. When these acids\/bases dissolve into water, they very nearly completely dissociate into their ions. These compounds are said to be strong acids and strong bases. There is a list of strong acids and strong bases that you need to memorize:  Strong acids: .  Strong bases: group I and II metals paired with hydroxide in an ionic compound (ex. NaOH)   Weak acids and weak bases are ones where the compound dissociates into ions when put into water, but not completely. There is still a measurable amount of the starting compound left over. This is because the reverse reaction still occurs to an appreciable extent. These weak acids and bases partially dissociate into ions when dissolved. Thankfully there is no list of weak acids\/bases that you need to memorize. All you need to know is that if you’re dealing with an acid or base that isn’t a strong acid or base, that it will be a weak one instead.   Exercise 3:      Write the list of strong acids that you need to know.      Try to figure out a mneumonic device to help you remember this list. Share it with a classmate.

  "body": " Acids and Bases 2    Conjugate acid\/base pairs   The dissociation of an acid or base is a reversible reaction (excepting strong acids and bases). If acetic acid functions as an acid, donating its H + to something else, then acetate results as a product. In the reverse reaction, that acetate ion would accept an H + once again becoming acetic acid. Thus acetate would be functioning as a base. Every acid produces a base after donating its H + . Likewise, every base produces an acid after accepting an H + , because the reverse reaction would have the product donating the H + that the base form had just received.  Every acid will therefore form a base in a chemical reaction. This is called the conjugate base of that acid. Together they form a conjugate acid-base pair , two molecules whose only difference is the presence or absence of an H + . Likewise every base will form a conjugate acid after accepting an H + in a reaction, and they together for a conjugate acid-base pair.  What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH 4 not an acid while HCl is? The truth is that every compound with a hydrogen atom is potentially an acid, but some of them are so weak that we don’t consider them to be an acid (CH 4 is an example of this). The strength of an acid is related to the stability of its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is very stable, then it is easy for the acid to lose an H + and form its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is an anion that we’ve seen before (monoatomic or polyatomic), then it’s stable. In the case of , its conjugate base would be . This is unstable because it would put a negative charge on a carbon atom, something we’ve never seen before (reminder: carbon isn’t very electronegative and thus wouldn’t like to have excess electrons). Negative charges can exist on highly electronegative elements such as the halogens and oxygen. If a molecule has a positive charge and has a hydrogen atom, it can often act as an acid since losing the H + can stabilize the molecule by also removing the positive charge (ex.   In order for a molecule to act as a base, the molecule must have a lone pair of electrons in order to form a new bond with the H + that it would accept. In addition, the conjugate acid must be stable. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms often have lone pairs of electrons and are especially good at accepting H + . Also, molecules that have a negative charge and lone pairs of electrons are often good bases because if they accept an H + , the negative charge will get neutralized (ex. ).   Exercise 4:      For the following pairs of compounds, identify them as a conjugate acid-base pair or not a conjugate acid-base pair                                      For the following pairs of compounds, the first compound is a reactant and the second compound is a product. Identify the first compound as an acid or base and the 2 nd compound as a conjugate acid or conjugate base.            \/        \/        \/       \/        Which of the following compounds is likely to be a good acid, a good base, or neither and why?                                      Water as an acid and base   We already learned that acids donate H + or increase the concentration of H + in solution. This is a bit of an oversimplification. In water, H + essentially doesn’t exist, because it very rapidly undergoes a reaction with water that is shown below:     H 3 O + is a polyatomic ion called hydronium ion . Chemists will typically use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably, so just be aware that H + really means H 3 O + if the acid is in water. Another term to be aware of is that H + is sometimes called a “proton”. Why? Well most hydrogen atoms have 1 proton, no neutrons, and 1 electron…take away the electron to form H + and all you have leftover is 1 proton.  We’ve discussed the definition of an acid and a base and have seen examples of what happens when acids or bases are mixed with water. In this section, we’re going to have a bit more formal treatment of what happens when an acid or base is mixed with water. See the chart below:          What is being mixed with water  Water acts as a…  Water becomes…  Example reaction    Acid (Strong or weak)  Base  Hydronium ion     Strong Base  Acid  Hydroxide ion     Weak Base  Acid  Hydroxide ion       Note: when nitrogen containing bases are mixed with water, the product is a salt with hydroxide. The base accepts a proton from water and forms an ionic compound with the leftover hydroxide as shown in the table above and the additional reactions below:      So nitrogen containing bases that are aqueous can be written as salts with hydroxide. However, they are weak bases so the reactant form also remains. Either form is appropriate to write as shown in the table below:         Nitrogen containing base examples  Form 1  Form 2                    Since water can act both as an acid and a base, we can write the following reaction where one water is an acid and another is a base. This reaction is continually happening in a sample of liquid water:     So in a sample of water, there is always some hydronium ion and some hydroxide ion. If water is neutral (ie. not acidic or basic), then the concentration of hydroxide and hydronium ions are equal. If water is acidic (for instance, if an acid is added to water), then extra hydronium ion has been produced and the amount of hydronium ion exceeds the amount of hydroxide ion. If the water is basic, (for instance, if a base is added to water), then extra hydroxide ions have been produced and the amount of hydroxide exceeds the amount of hydronium ions. There is an inverse relationship between the amount of hydroxide and hydronium ions in solution. If we multiply their concentrations (measured in molarity), we get a constant, K w , which has a value of 1x10 -14 at 25 o C. This is shown by the equation below. In the equation, the brackets indicate that these are the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide, measured in molarity. Note: it is crucial that you use the concentrations in molarity and not any other unit for this calculation. K w is a unitless value (even though it seems like it should have units of M 2 ) but the reason why is beyond the scope of this course.     This equation can be used to find the concentration of hydroxide or hydronium ion, if we’re given the concentration of the other one. It can also be used to find the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions in a neutral solution as shown below:  Since it’s neutral,   Therefore, becomes   So    Exercise 1:     Write the equation for adding the following compounds to water:    Ca(OH) 2     H 2 SO 4 (write the reaction for it losing only one proton)    H 2 SO 4 (write the reaction for it losing two protons)    NH 2 CH 2 CH 3       Determine the concentration of hydronium ion if the concentration of hydroxide is:    3.3 x 10 -9 M    0.0003 M    0.01 M      Look at your answers in #2.

Look at your answers in #4. What happens to the hydroxide concentration as the hydronium concentration rises?    At 0 o C, the value of K w is 1.14 x 10 -15 .

  "body": " Acids and Bases 3    Neutralization reactions   The other class of reaction that we’ve seen before in this chapter is a neutralization reaction. Here we’ll cover it in more detail. If the neutralization reaction is between a strong acid and strong base, then the products will be water and a salt as shown in the equations below:  Chemical equation:     Ionic equation:     Net ionic equation:     Any neutralization reaction involving a strong acid reacting with a strong base will have an ionic equation of:     When weak acids or bases are used in a neutralization reaction, we can write chemical equations in different ways. For ammonia, we can write it as or . Also, for weak acids, they somewhat dissociate (ie. are somewhat ionic) so they can be written in two different ways in an ionic equation(ex. . Using these different forms as reactants in a neutralization reaction will result in different equations. Neither one is right or wrong…in actuality, both sets of equations are happening all at the same time.          Way 1  Way 2    Chemical equation      Ionic equation      Net ionic equation       Way 3  Way 4    Chemical equation      Ionic equation      Net ionic equation       The first way of writing the above reactions emphasizes that the ammonia can accept a proton from solution, forming the conjugate acid, ammonium ion. The second way highlights the fact that in this reaction, the acid and base are neutralized. The third way, emphasizes that hydrofluoric acid can directly transfer a proton to ammonia. The fourth way focuses on the ability of HF to function as a weak acid, neutralizing hydroxide in solution.  Don’t be daunted by the wide variety of reactions shown above. I’m showing these to you to highlight the many ways that you might see reactions written and to emphasize that, when we mix weak acids and weak bases, there are numerous chemical reactions that are occurring at the same time.  We can figure out any of the reactions written above by doing the following:    Start with the ionic equation!    Recognize what is ionic and what is covalent. Dissociate the ions if the compound is ionic.    Recognize if you have a strong acid\/base or a weak acid\/base    If it’s a strong acid\/base, always dissociate the ions    If it’s a weak acid\/base, you’ll be directed to dissociate it or not        Transfer an H + from the acid to the base and write the resulting products    If you have H+, transfer that    If you have OH-, use it as the H+ acceptor    If you don’t have H+, remove an H+ from the weak acid that you were directed to not dissociate    If you don’t have OH-, transfer the H+ to the weak base that you were directed to not dissociate      Write an ionic equation, paying attention to how many of each ion you need for the charges to balance appropriately. Also, make sure that both sides of the equation contain all of the ions. You should now be able to combine the ions together to create the chemical equation from the ionic equation or to remove ions that are the same in the reactants and products, thus creating a net ionic equation    See the example below:  Write a chemical equation, ionic equation, and net ionic equation for the reaction between sodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium hydroxide. Do not dissociate the hydrogen carbonate ion in the equations.    Work on the ionic equation    Sodium hydrogen phosphate has sodium ions and hydrogen phosphate ions:       The hydrogen phosphate ion can be an acid (it has a proton it can donate, becoming phosphate) or a base (it can accept a proton becoming dihydrogen phosphate). In either case, it is a weak acid\/base and we’re directed in the problem to not dissociate it further. In this problem, it will be a weak acid, because our other reactant is a strong base.  We should recognize that potassium hydroxide is a strong base and immediately dissociate it as shown       We transfer a proton from the acid to the base. In this case the hydrogen phosphate transfers a proton to hydroxide forming the products:         We can start writing the ionic equation by writing the reactants and products:       We need to recognize that we need two sodium ions to balance the -2 charge of hydrogen phosphate. The +1 charge of the potassium already balances the -1 charge of hydroxide:     Lastly, we should make sure that the sodium and potassium ions are still there in the products…they didn’t just vanish!     And that’s our ionic equation! We can now combine the ions to create the chemical equation:     We can also eliminate ions that are the same on both sides of the ionic equation to give the following net ionic equation:      Exercise 2:      Write a balanced chemical reaction for the following reactions between strong acids and strong bases:      KOH and HI      H 2 SO 4 (only the first H + leaving) with Ca(OH) 2      Sr(OH) 2 and HCl      HNO 3 and RbOH        What is the net ionic equation for all of the reactions in #1?      Write an ionic equation for the following reactions:      NH 3 with sodium hydrogen sulfate (don’t allow the ammonia or hydrogen sulfate to dissociate)      NH 4 OH with sodium hydrogen sulfate (allow the hydrogen sulfate and ammonium hydroxide to dissociate)      NH 4 OH with nitric acid (allow the ammonium hydroxide to dissociate)      Phosphoric acid and sodium acetate (Don’t allow the phosphoric acid to dissociate or acetate to dissociate)      Acetic acid and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (Allow the acetic acid to dissociate but not the dihydrogen phosphate)        For the reactions in #3, write a balanced chemical equation      For the reactions in #3, write a net ionic equation      pH   When scientists describe how acidic or basic a solution is, we could report the concentration of hydronium ion or hydroxide ion. However, because the numbers are so small and usually written in scientific notation, this becomes quite cumbersome. To solve this problem, we instead often transform the concentration of hydronium ion into a pH value using the formula below:     This version of the equation can be used to find the pH value from a concentration of hydronium ion (which MUST be molarity). We can figure out the pH of a neutral solution as shown:     pH values lower than 7 are said to be acidic solutions. pH values above 7 are basic solutions. The reason why will be determined as a part of your exercises.  In some cases, we’ll need to figure out the concentration of hydronium ion from a pH value. This requires rearrangement of the pH equation using algebra skills. The tricky part of this is that we need to ‘undo’ the log function. This is done by taking 10 and raising it to the power of everything on that side of the equation as shown below:               Exercise 3:      If the concentration of hydronium ion is 0.0044M, calculate the pH of the solution      If the concentration of hydroxide ion is 0.0044M, calculate the pH of the solution (hint: first calculate the hydronium ion concentration like we did previously)      If the pH of a solution is 4.3, calculate the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration. Which is greater?      Repeat the same calculations, but at a pH value of 9.2.        If 1.00 g of HCl is added to 2.0 L water, what is the new pH?      Step 1: How many moles of HCl was added? How many moles of hydronium was added? How much hydronium ion is present in the water (you can ignore the 1x10 -7 M hydronium that was already there…for these problems it is an insignificant amount)      Step 2: Calculate the molarity of hydronium ion      Step 3: Calculate the pH        If 1.00g of NaOH is added to 0.59 L of water, what is the new pH?

  "body": " Acids and Bases 4    Buffers    Buffers are substances that can be added to water to make the water resistant to changes in pH. A buffer consists of either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. How does this mixture of substances make the solution more resistant to changes in pH?  When a strong acid is added to water, it will form hydronium ions and the concentration of the hydronium ions formed will be the same as the concentration of the acid that was just added, because a strong acid completely dissociates upon addition to water. Likewise if a strong base is added to water, it will form the number of hydroxide ions that are contained in that substance that was added, again because a strong base will completely dissociate when added to water. The additional hydronium ion or hydroxide ion will then directly affect the pH of the solution.   When a buffer is present, the solution contains an additional solute that is an acid and another that is a base. These acids and bases are capable of reacting with any base or acid that might get added to the solution, helping to neutralize it. The picture below might help.  Every buffer has a buffering capacity . This is the amount of additional acid or base that can be added without exceeding the amount of buffering compounds. So if a buffered solution contains 0.1M weak base and 0.2M of its conjugate acid, then the solution could handle the addition of up to 0.1M hydronium ions before running out of weak base (because the weak base will react with the hydronium ions) and up to 0.2M hydroxide ions (because the hydroxide would react with the conjugate acid). Amounts of hydronium above 0.1M would exceed the buffering capacity of the solution as would addition of more than 0.2M hydroxide ion.   Exercise 4:      Which of the following mixtures of chemicals would make good buffers?            \/                      \/             Create a drawing similar to the figure above that shows how a buffer can resist changes to pH caused by adding in strong base.      If a solution contains 0.11 moles of weak base and 0.33 moles of weak acid, then how many moles of nitric acid could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      How many moles of sodium hydroxide could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?      How many moles of calcium hydroxide could be added without exceeding the buffering capacity?        Acid-Base titration review   An acid base titration is simply a solution reaction that is used to measure the concentration of an acid or base. If we begin with a known volume of solution with an unknown concentration of acid, we can determine its concentration by measuring the number of moles of base that we have to add to neutralize it. The easiest way to do that is to slowly add a solution of base of known concentration to the solution using a burette, which allows us to measure the volume of base needed. If we have the volume and concentration of the base, we can use this to determine the number of moles of base. From there, we can convert moles of base to moles of acid using the balanced chemical equation. If we know moles of acid and its volume (remember we need to know this when we start the titration), then we can divide them to determine the concentration.

Divisor: the number of parts that the dividend is being divided into.         Coefficient: the leading part of scientific notation. It should always be a number between 1 and 10 and should be written as a decimal.         Base: follows the coefficient in scientific notation. The coefficient is multiplied by the base. The base is always 10 raised to some integer power.         Exact number: a value that is countable, a definition, or a desired quantity. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures.         Measured number: a value that was measured and thus isn't known exactly. Every measured number has a non-zero amount of uncertainty.         Significant figures: the digits in a number that both convey its quantity and that are known reliably.
