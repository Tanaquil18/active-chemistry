<p><strong>Section 1: Classification of matter</strong></p>
<p>There are different ways to classify matter, but this diagram is one
that that can help you compartmentalize your knowledge throughout the
course. The diagram strives to classify matter according to its
complexity and arrangement. This sort of classification has historical
importance to chemistry because it what allowed scientists to begin to
gain an understanding of what matter is made of. For instance, it is
essential to know what an element is in order to understand that a
compound is made up of elements.</p>
<p>The highest classes of matter on the chart are
<strong>mixtures</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and <strong>pure
substances</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. The difference between these terms
is that mixtures consist of multiple substances, while pure substances
are only one. The difference between these can be obvious, but that
isn’t always the case. For instance, you can clearly see that a glass of
sand and water contains multiple substances because we can see the sand
and the water and they clearly appear to be different. In the case of
salt water, it would be difficult to determine whether it’s a mixture of
substances (water and salt) by simply looking at it. Sugar, is a pure
substance, but brass is not…so how do we know that something is a pure
substance or a mixture?</p>
<p>This is not as straightforward as it might initially seem, but we can
come up with rules to help us out. A mixture contains two different
substances AND those substances can be separated by <strong>physical
processes</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. A physical process is a one that
doesn’t need other substances to be added. Also a physical process will
preserve the identity and characteristics of each of the components.
Easy examples are boiling and freezing a liquid. The identity of that
liquid is the same if it’s a solid, liquid, or gas despite it having
somewhat different characteristics. Other examples of physical processes
include filtering, cutting, sorting, etc. Sand and water can be
separated by filtration, a physical process, and therefore sandy water
is classified as a mixture. In the example of salt water we know that it
is a mixture because we can separate it into its components (salt and
water) by boiling the water and taking advantage of the fact that salt
and water have different <strong>physical properties</strong><a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><strong>.</strong> A physical
property is a property (like boiling point, freezing point, size, color,
etc.) that can be observed without altering the chemical identity of a
substance.</p>
<p>Within the category of mixtures, we have <strong>homogenous
mixtures</strong><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and <strong>heterogenous
mixtures</strong><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. The difference between these terms
deals with the arrangement of the components. If the components are
evenly distributed throughout the mixture, then we have a homogeneous
mixture. If the arrangement is not uniform, then it’s a heterogeneous
mixture. Heterogeneous mixtures are sometimes obvious, like sand in
water; if you let it sit for a little while the sand settles to the
bottom. Sometimes heterogeneous mixtures are not immediately
identifiable as such. Consider blood; it initially looks like a uniform
red liquid. However, if you let it sit for a little while, the cells in
the blood will soon settle to the bottom of the container, similar to
sand in water.</p>
<p>In a homogeneous mixture, the various substances are evenly
distributed, even at a microscopic level. Because of this, you will not
see the various particles that make up a homogeneous mixture.
<strong>Solutions</strong><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> are homogeneous mixtures
where one substance (the <strong>solute</strong><a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>) is
dissolved in a larger amount of the second substance (the
<strong>solvent</strong><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>). The solvent and the solute can be
the same state of matter or different states. For instance, oxygen gas
can be dissolved in water, forming a solution. Salt can also be
dissolved in water. Gases can be dissolved in one another (for example,
air is a solution where small amounts of oxygen gas, carbon dioxide,
etc. are dissolved in the solvent of nitrogen gas). There are also
solutions made of metals, and these are called <strong>alloys</strong><a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Bronze is a mixture of zinc and
copper where the two substances have so fully dispersed that the mixture
is now uniform. Homogenous mixtures can still be separated by physical
processes, but they often require more effort (ex. many heterogeneous
mixtures can be separated by filtration, whereas a homogenous mixture
may require boiling, condensing, or melting).</p>
<p>Pure substances, on the other hand, cannot be separated by physical
processes. If you boil pure liquid water, it will be entirely converted
into water vapor. If you condense the water vapor it will entirely turn
back into liquid water. In both cases, there isn’t any substance that is
separated from the water or water vapor by carrying out these physical
processes; the substance remains unchanged. Physical processes cannot
change the composition of a pure substance. The discovery of pure
substances and their further classification into elements and compounds
was essential to our understanding of the composition of the world
around us. This will be further explored in the next section.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2: Relationship between elements and
compounds</strong></p>
<p>Pure substances can be subdivided into <strong>elements</strong><a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and <strong>compounds</strong><a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a><strong>.</strong> The distinction
between elements and compounds depends on whether they can be broken
down into simpler units by <strong>chemical processes</strong><a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. A chemical process is a reaction
that often (but not always) involves the addition of one or more
additional reactants and always results in the chemical identity of the
starting substance changing. Chemical processes may result in a
significant change in the appearance of the starting substance or
evolution of a gas, but in other cases there may be little obvious
indication that a reaction has occurred (that’s a subject that is
covered in other classes like organic chemistry in much more detail). If
a pure substance can be broken down into simpler units by a chemical
process, then we’re dealing with a compound. If it can’t, then we’re
dealing with an element.</p>
<p>We now know of the existence of over 100 different elements. Each
element can be found arranged in the <strong>periodic table</strong><a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> (more about the periodic table in a
later chapter). If you can find a substance in the periodic table, then
it’s an element. The cells in the periodic table contain information
about each element. For right now, we’ll focus on the name each element
as well as its <strong>element symbol</strong><a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>,
a short abbreviation that is used to represent that element (example: H
is the element symbol for hydrogen). Many of these element symbols make
sense with the English name of the element. Other element symbols are
derived from the Latin name of the element (example: sodium is called
natrium in Latin and its symbol is Na).</p>
<p>What then is the relationship between an element and a compound. This
relationship was one of the key discoveries in chemistry, and its
discovery opened up our understanding of the foundational composition of
all matter. One of these early insights came from the discovery of the
<strong>Law of constant composition</strong><a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.
This law states that compounds always have the same ratio of elements.
For instance, water always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 8
grams of oxygen. Methane, another compound, always has a ratio of 1 gram
of hydrogen for every 3 grams of carbon. This discovery showed
scientists that compounds were comprised of elements in very specific
ratios.</p>
<p>The next key discovery came from comparing the ratios of elements in
one compound to the ratios found in other compounds where both compounds
consisted of the same elements. For instance, methane has a 1:3 ratio
between the mass of hydrogen and the mass of carbon as stated in the
previous paragraph. Ethane is another compound made of carbon and
hydrogen, but the ratio between hydrogen and carbon is 1:4. If we divide
these two ratios <span class="math inline">$\left( \frac{1\ g\
hydrogen}{3\ g\ carbon} \div \frac{1\ g\ hydrogen}{4\ g\ carbon} =
\frac{1\ g\ hydrogen}{3\ g\ carbon} \times \frac{4\ g\ carbon}{1\ g\
hydrogen} = \frac{4}{3} \right)\ $</span>we get a ratio of 4:3, meaning
that ethane contains 4/3 as much carbon as methane. This can be done for
many other pairs of compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. If
we do this, we get other ratios like 1:2, 1:3, or 3:2. In every case, we
begin to see that when we divide the ratios of carbon and hydrogen
between two compounds, we always get <u>ratios of integers</u>! This is
known as the <strong>Law of multiple proportions</strong><a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a><strong>.</strong> The realization
that there are integer relationships between the composition of
different compounds means that the carbon and hydrogen in these
compounds occurs in <u>discrete countable units</u>. These discrete
countable units are called <strong>atoms</strong><a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Law of constant composition and the law of multiple
proportions, we now know that all compounds are comprised of atoms of
various elements that are combined together a specific ratio. This ratio
can be written as a <strong>chemical formula</strong><a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a><strong>.</strong> The formula for a
compound is written by listing the element symbol followed by a
subscript number indicating the number of atoms of that element that
comprise the compound’s formula unit (please note, that if there is only
one atom of a particular type that the number 1 is NOT written). So
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> has 2 sodium atoms, one sulfur atom, and 4
oxygen atoms in every unit of that compound.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3: States of matter</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>states of matter</strong><a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
are solids, liquids, and gases. When a substance undergoes a change in
its state, it still retains its same chemical identity, and thus state
changes are reversible. Water still has its same chemical formula and
identity regardless of whether it is ice, liquid water, or water vapor.
Each of these states has different properties, but they are properties
of that state, not of water itself.</p>
<p>The properties that define a <strong>solid</strong><a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
are that it has a fixed shape and volume. Solids do not flow. They can
change shape but require some outside force to cause this to happen
(like bending a nail with a hammer). On a microscopic scale, the reason
for these properties is that the particles that make up the solid are
held together by forces that are so strong that the particles can’t move
past one another. As a result, the arrangement of the particles is
fixed, and the shape of the substance as a whole remains fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Liquids</strong><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>, on the other hand,
have a fixed volume, but not a fixed shape. They will take on the shape
of their container. Liquids can flow and move in response to gravity. On
a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the
attractive forces between the particles are strong enough to maintain
contact between the particles but weak enough that the particles can
move past one another. As a result, the entire liquid is capable of
movement and flow. At the same time, the attraction between the
particles ensures that they never fully separate, so the volume remains
fixed regardless of the shape.</p>
<p><strong>Gases</strong><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> have neither a fixed
shape nor a fixed volume. A gas will always fill up the entirety of the
container that it is placed in. Gases can flow like liquids, but their
component particles have enough energy that they can flow in all
directions, completely filling up their container. The microscopic
reason for these properties is that the particles in a gas are moving so
rapidly past one another that they don’t interact at all (in actuality,
there are very small interactions between gas particles, but chemists
often ignore this). As a result a gas will always spread out to occupy
the entirety of its container, meaning that a gas will not have a fixed
shape nor a fixed volume.</p>
<p>The reason for the differences between the states of matter is that
the particles that make them up have different amounts of
<strong>kinetic energy</strong><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>. Kinetic energy is the
energy of motion and is affected by both the mass of an object and its
velocity (ex. a baseball thrown by a toddler will hurt a lot less than
by one thrown by a professional pitcher due to the difference in
velocity and hence the difference in kinetic energy). The particles in a
gas are moving much faster than those in a liquid; the particles in a
liquid are moving much faster than those in a solid. Because of this, we
can conclude that the particles in a gas have more kinetic energy than
those in a liquid and that those in a liquid have more have more kinetic
energy than those in a solid. So in order to turn a solid into a liquid
(<strong>melting</strong><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>), we have to add
energy to the substance by heating it. The same is true for turning a
liquid into a gas (<strong>boiling</strong><a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
or <strong>vaporizing</strong><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>). If we want to turn a
gas into a liquid (<strong>condensing</strong><a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>)
we have to remove kinetic energy from the substance by cooling it. The
same is true for <strong>freezing</strong><a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> a
substance (the process of turning a liquid into a solid).</p>
