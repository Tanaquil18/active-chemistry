<p><strong>Section 1: Energy, heat and temperature</strong></p>
<p>You just learned about kinetic energy, but was is energy itself? In
order to understand energy, we must first define <strong>work</strong><a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Work is when a force is applied to
an object over some distance. <strong>Energy</strong><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is
a property of an object or substance that describes its ability to do
work, or to produce light or heat. Energy is a very important
consideration in chemistry. It influences the properties of matter,
including its state and temperature. Additionally, energy may be
released or consumed by reactions. All reactions require energy input to
occur, and some require so much energy that they won’t occur unless the
reaction is heated or there is a spark (ex. a mixture of hydrogen gas
and oxygen gas will not react with one another unless the reaction is
provided with a flame or spark to get it going).</p>
<p>Energy can be subdivided into two classes: <strong>kinetic
energy</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and <strong>potential
energy</strong><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Kinetic energy is energy of motion
or vibration. Potential energy is stored energy that could potentially
be converted into kinetic energy. A classic physics example is that a
boulder sitting on a small hill has a small amount of potential energy
compared to the same boulder sitting on top of a mountain. Due to the
height difference, the boulder would speed up more if it were pushed off
the mountain than a small hill. Once the boulder is pushed, the
potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy. In chemistry, we’re
not usually thinking about boulders rolling down hills. Instead, energy
is stored in the form of <strong>bonds</strong><a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
that join atoms and molecules together. When this energy is released,
the motion of the atoms or molecules increases.</p>
<p>The movement of atoms and molecules, including rotations and
vibrations, is chemical kinetic energy. When we measure
<strong>temperature</strong><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> what we are measuring is
the amount of chemical kinetic energy in a substance. As energy is added
to a substance, the temperature generally increases, and this is due to
increased motion of the particles that make it up.</p>
<p>Both energy and temperature are quantifiable in chemistry. The SI
units of energy are joules. In this course, due to its focus on health
sciences, we will more commonly use the unit of calorie (1 calorie =
4.184 joules). The unit calories (abbreviate cal) can use the metric
prefixes that you’ve previously learned with the most commonly version
being a kilocalorie, or kcal. A calorie is defined as the amount of
energy that will raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 degree
Celsius. When we’re dealing with the energy content of food, we often
use units of Calories (note that it is now capitalized). 1 Calorie is
equivalent to 1kcal or 1000 calories.</p>
<p>For temperature, we have 2 units that are commonly used by society
(Fahrenheit and Celsius) and another that is used extensively in science
(Kelvin). Fahrenheit is related to Celsius by the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">℉ = 1.8 × ℃ + 32</span></p>
<p>In this formula, the 1.8 and 32 are EXACT numbers. Kelvin is a
temperature scale that has its zero point at absolute zero (ie. the
coldest possible temperature where there is no motion). To convert from
Celsius to Kelvin, we use the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>K</em> = ℃ + 273.15</span></p>
<p>Kelvin will always have a positive value, and for this reason, it
often must be used as the unit of temperature in scientific formulas.
Using these two formulae, we can easily convert between different
temperature units by using some algebra skills:</p>
<p>Example: Express the temperature <span class="math inline">53℉</span>
in Celsius and Kelvin.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We have a formula to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius and
another formula to go from Celsius to Kelvin. Let’s determine Celsius
first, then Kelvin.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s plug in the temperature in Fahrenheit and then rearrange
the equation to solve for Celsius:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">℉ = 1.8 × ℃ + 32</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">53 = 1.8 × ℃ + 32</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">53 − 32 = 1.8 × ℃ + 32 − 32</span>
(Subtract 32 from both sides)</p>
<p><span class="math display">21 = 1.8 × ℃</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\frac{21}{1.8} = \frac{1.8 \times
℃}{1.8}$</span> (Divide both sides by 1.8)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">11.66666 = ℃</span> (Round to correct
number of significant figures)</p>
<p><span
class="math display">12 <em>d</em><em>e</em><em>g</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>e</em><em>s</em> <em>C</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>u</em><em>s</em> = ℃</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Now take the temperature in Celsius and plug it into the formula
to solve for Kelvin:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display"><em>K</em> = ℃ + 273.15</span></p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>K</em> = 12 + 273.15</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>K</em> = 285.15</span> (Round to the
correct number of significant figures)</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>K</em> = 285 <em>K</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>v</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></span></p>
<p>With 3 different temperature scales, it’s important to have an idea
of how hot values are in each of them. You should know the following
values in each unit of temperature:</p>

<p><strong>Section 2: Food energy</strong></p>
<p>When we buy food at the grocery store, it has the amount of energy
that our bodies can obtain from digestion printed on the label in the
form of Calories (note: that it is capitalized). This value is obtained
by calculating the amount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the
food. Carbohydrates and proteins both contain 4 Calories of energy for
every gram. Fats, on the other hand, have more energy, containing 9
Calories in every gram (consider the 4 and 9 to be exact numbers, even
though they are technically measured). If we know how many grams of
carbohydrates, proteins, and fat are in a serving of food, we can
calculate how many Calories it contains. See the example below:</p>
<p>A serving of food contains 3.0 g of carbohydrates, 5.0 g of fat, and
17 g of protein. How many Calories are in a serving?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We want to determine how many Calories come from each class of
biomolecule and then add those values together to get the total.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>We need to use dimensional analysis:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Carbohydrates: <span class="math inline">$3.0\ g\ \left( \frac{4\

<li><p>Fat: <span class="math inline">$5.0\ g\ \left( \frac{9\
Calories}{g} \right) = 45\ Calories$</span></p></li>
<li><p>Protein: <span class="math inline">$17\ g\left( \frac{4\
Calories}{g} \right) = 68\ Calories$</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Then add: <span
class="math inline">12 <em>C</em><em>a</em><em>l</em> + 45 <em>C</em><em>a</em><em>l</em> + 68 <em>C</em><em>a</em><em>l</em> = 125 <em>C</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>s</em></span></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Exercise 2: Food energy</strong></em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A serving of food has 10.0g protein, 25g carbohydrates, and 3.0
grams of fat per serving. How many Calories are in that serving? How
many calories are in that serving?</p></li>
<li><p>A serving of food contains 17 g of fat and 45 g of carbohydrates.
Are most of the Calories in that serving due to fat or carbohydrates?
Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>A soda contains 38 g of carbohydrates per serving. A single
bottle of soda contains 2.5 servings. If you consume 3 bottles of soda
in a day, how many Calories are you ingesting?</p></li>

<p><strong>Section 3: Electromagnetic radiation</strong></p>
<p>When we are talking about energy in chemistry, one common way in
which energy can be released or taken up by matter is in the form of
<strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong><a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.
Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that can travel through
space as both a wave and a particle called a <strong>photon</strong><a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. We all experience electromagnetic
radiation. Visible light is one form of electromagnetic radiation.
However, even blind people are able to experience non-visible forms of
electromagnetic radiation such as infrared rays (think about how light
from the sun makes things hot…a lot of this is due to infrared
radiation). There are several different forms of electromagnetic
radiation: gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared
rays, microwaves, and radio waves.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation exists as a wave. Waves can be depicted
graphically as shown below. Note the definition of a
<strong>wavelength</strong><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> depicted in the drawing
below. A wavelength is the distance between two identical points on
different parts of the same wave. The list of forms of electromagnetic
radiation listed in the paragraph above (gamma rays, x-rays, UV rays,
visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves) are arranged
in order of increasing wavelengths. Radio waves have the longest
wavelengths (meters or even kilometers long) and gamma rays have the
shortest wavelengths (&lt;0.01 nanometers).</p>
<p><img src="media/image1.wmf"
style="width:6.79028in;height:1.86111in" /></p>
<p>The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is related to two other
properties: energy and <strong>frequency</strong><a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.
The shorter the wavelength, the more energy that the electromagnetic
radiation has. You can try to understand this by thinking about trying
to vibrate a stretched out spring…you don’t have to use much energy to
get the spring to vibrate slowly (long wavelengths), but you have to
expend a lot of energy to get the spring to vibrate quickly (short
wavelengths). An in-class demonstration can be helpful here. Frequency
refers to the number of waves that pass a certain point every second.
Electromagnetic radiation, regardless of the type, travels with the same
speed (known as the speed of light). If the waves are spaced close
together, then more waves will pass by every second compared to a case
where the waves are further apart. As a result, light with a long
wavelength will have low frequencies. The exercises below will help you
to visualize this.</p>
<p><em><strong>Exercise 3: Electromagnetic radiation</strong></em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Draw a wave with 5 wavelengths</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Draw another wave with 5 shorter wavelengths and another with 5
longer wavelengths on the same sheet of paper, draw them one above the
other in a stack of sorts</p></li>
<li><p>Hold a pencil or pen above them as a line of reference and drag
your paper underneath. Which wave that you drew has waves pass the line
provided by the pen/pencil fastest.</p></li>
<li><p>Do longer wavelengths or shorter wavelengths of light have
greater frequencies?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If light has a wavelength of 22 cm, how many meters is the
wavelength?</p></li>
<li><p>What forms of electromagnetic radiation have energies greater
than visible light? Less than visible light?</p></li>
<li><p>What forms of electromagnetic radiation have wavelengths longer
than visible light? Shorter than visible light? Longer than microwaves?
Shorter than x-rays?</p></li>
<li><p>What forms of electromagnetic radiation have frequencies greater
than UV rays? Lower than infrared rays?</p></li>
