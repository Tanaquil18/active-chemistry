		<term>Section 1: Natural and the Supernatural</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this textbook, I’m going to be assuming that the reader acknowledges the existence of the Christian God and His Son, Jesus Christ. My discussions of faith, science, and ethics will come from the theological tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, but will have a lot in common with other Christian denominations. If there are areas in the text that seem to be at odd with your own personal beliefs, I hope the information contained in here can serve as a starting point for further discussions and debates.
	</p>

	<p>
		Catholics acknowledge Jesus and thus can’t separate their discussions of the <term>natural world</term><fn>	<p>
		Everything that comprises our universe. The natural world are those things that we can see and touch. The natural world can be explored through science.
	</p></fn> from the <term>supernatural</term><fn>	<p>
		Those things that are outside of nature or the laws of physics. We can learn about supernatural things by logical reasoning, philosophy, and theology.
	</p></fn> (bolded text is usually indicating an important term that you SHOULD know the definition of. In this textbook, definitions and extra commentary are provided as footnotes at the bottom of the page). Both the natural and supernatural are components of reality and are interdependent. Catholics acknowledge the existence of God, and thus existence that is beyond nature, in other words, the supernatural. As St. Thomas Aquinas argues in his <em>Summa Theologica</em>, the creation of the natural world presupposes a supernatural cause; nature cannot be the first cause. He argues this at length through the “first mover” argument. In this argument he establishes that the natural world is dependent on God for its existence. This argument goes something like this:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				The natural world is full of motion. Matter moves, time moves, etc.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				All motion must have a prior cause.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Natural things have the potential to move, that is they have <term>potency</term><fn>	<p>
				Potency is the potential to change in some specific way. Natural things have the potency of motion. They aren’t necessarily moving initially, but after the potential of motion is actualized by something else, the thing is now moving.
			</p></fn>. That potential can be realized through the action of some outside cause. Natural things also have <term>actuality</term><fn>	<p>
				Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. For instance, a spark has the ability to cause a paper to start on fire. The spark possesses the property of being able to actualize the fire. The paper possesses the potency of burning.
			</p></fn>, the ability to bring forth potency (ie. natural things can cause other natural things to move). The bringing forth of potency is a change in that thing.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				There must be a first actuality to bring forth all motion. That actuality can’t have potency, otherwise it would have had to be acted on by something else first. We can summarize this by saying that there must be a “first mover”.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				There is a philosophical need for an actor that can actualize motion but remain unchangeable. We call this actor God. God must therefore lack potency (He doesn’t change). Instead, God is pure actuality (<term>Actus Purus</term><fn>	<p>
				Actus Purus means pure actuality. It is something that possesses the property of actuality without any potency. Actus Purus can cause change in other things but cannot be changed itself.
			</p></fn>). He can initiate change or motion but can’t be acted upon or changed by other things.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Actus purus must initiate all motion. Therefore God must have initiate all of nature.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		After having established the existence of the supernatural in addition to the natural world, many questions arise about the importance of each and the relationship between them (example: miracles). In many ways, the Catholic faith is grounded in the supernatural. God has a supernatural nature and is both the Creator and Redeemer. Humanity is dependent on Him for existence, and the hope for eternal life rests solely in Him. Because of the supremacy of God’s supernatural nature, one might argue that the best thing that each of us can do with our lives is to put all of effort into understanding the supernatural, thus minimizing the importance of the material world. Indeed portions of scripture could be interpreted as saying that this is the approach that Catholics should take. Two examples:
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”</em> 1 John 2:15
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“’Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?</em> <em>Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?</em> <em>Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?</em> <em>Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.</em> <em>But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.</em> <em>If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?</em> <em>So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’</em> <em>All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</em> <em>But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.”</em> Matthew 6: 25-33.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, should we all study theology and scorn the study of the natural world? Hopefully it is obvious to you that this view is incomplete and thus misguided…but why?

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Summarize the first mover argument in your own words.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Explain the terms potency, actuality, and Actus Purus in your own words. What is the relationship between the three terms?
			</p>
		</li>

			<p>
				Would most superheroes be best classified as natural or supernatural? They are clearly exceptional, but are they supernatural?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Are angels natural or supernatural? Do angels possess potency, actuality, or both?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Is everything that is supernatural Actus Purus?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				As Catholics, we believe that God is not exclusively supernatural. We believe that Jesus is the unity of the supernatural and the natural in one person. How does this knowledge inform the way in which we should approach the relationship between the natural and the supernatural as Catholics? Is one more important than the other?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Catholics are called to be separate from the world, yet we are material creatures. What are ways in which we can practically abandon materialism?

		<term>Section 2: The Greatest Commandment</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In scripture, Jesus gives us the Greatest Commandment:
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“[Jesus] said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.</em> <em>This is the greatest and the first commandment.</em> <em>The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”</em> Matthew 22:37-39
	</p>

	<p>
		Each of us lives and acts in the natural world. God gives us his commandments to help us live according to His will. The greatest commandment unites the supernatural and natural world into one rule for us. We should love God, and when we love one another, we are loving God by loving them. Humans are body (natural) and soul (supernatural). If we are to love our neighbor in a <term>holistic</term><fn>	<p>
		Holistic means emphasizing the whole and showing concern about each of the component parts of a thing.
	</p></fn> way, we must show concern for their natural and supernatural needs. This is reflected in in the following passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and love.  Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.”</em> Catechism of the Catholic Church 1878
	</p>

	<p>
		How do we care for the material needs of others? In many cases this is obvious. All people need food, water, and shelter. Providing access to quality healthcare is another way in which we love our neighbor through natural means. As Catholics, we should strive to ensure that our care for neighbor is not solely a material benefit, but a spiritual one as well. By incorporating empathy, compassion, friendship, and brotherly/sisterly love into our material service to one another, we ensure that we are holistically loving our neighbor and serving their needs in the best possible way. The Catholic Church clearly shows us ways that we can care for the body and soul of our neighbor through the lists of corporal (bodily) and spiritual works of mercy.

	<p>
		There are other less obvious ways in which we are also called to love our neighbor. Human beings are part of creation and exist within the environment around them. We must therefore show love to neighbor by ALSO showing respect for Creation. This is emphasized in the following quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as well as a couple of Papal encyclicals:
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.  Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.”</em> Catechism of the Catholic Church 2415
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“The environment is God's gift to everyone, and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole… In nature, the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God's creative activity, which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs, material or otherwise, while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation.”</em> Caritas in Veritate 48.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“The created things of this world are not free of ownership: ‘For they are yours, O Lord, who love the living’ (Wis 11:26). This is the basis of our conviction that, as part of the universe, called into being by one Father, all of us are linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect.”</em> Laudato si 89.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“Moreover, when our hearts are authentically open to universal communion, this sense of fraternity excludes nothing and no one. It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty towards any creature is ‘contrary to human dignity’. We can hardly consider ourselves to be fully loving if we disregard any aspect of reality: ‘Peace, justice and the preservation of creation are three absolutely interconnected themes, which cannot be separated and treated individually without once again falling into reductionism’”</em> Laudato si 92.

		<em><term>Exercise 3: The Greatest Commandment</term></em>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				The Greatest Commandment sounds like two commandments. Explain why this is not the case.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Explain what I mean when I say that we are called to holistically love our neighbor.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Imagine that you receive healthcare in a clinic that is exceptional in healing you but is simultaneously cold and impersonal. How would you feel? Come up with concrete ideas for how you could prevent a patient from feeling this way if you were a medical professional.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Explain a concrete way in which our respect for the environment can manifest itself as love of neighbor. Similarly, explain a concrete way in which abuse of the environment can manifest itself in harming our neighbor.

	<p>
		Exercise 1:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Answers may vary (see the argument in the text to check for similarity to what you stated).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. Potency is some change that can be realized in a thing. Actus Purus is a term for God that describes Him as pure actuality without potency. Actuality brings forth potency. The first actualization must have been from Actus Purus.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				They are exceptional but natural. They can be seen and touched. Their powers often work within nature (example: spiderman can only swing because of his webs).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Angels are supernatural (example: they don’t exist in one particular space; their movement defies the laws of physics). Angels can change and therefore possess potency. They can also influence other things and thus have actuality.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Angels are an example of something that is supernatural that nonetheless possesses potency. Only God is Actus Purus.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Human nature and human bodies are a part of God, through his Son, Jesus. God is therefore body and spirit, natural and supernatural. If we are to love God, we must love both parts. In caring for others, we must care for their bodily and spiritual needs.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				When we say we should abandon materialism, we mean that we should abandon unhealthy attachments. For instance, food is good, but gluttony is sinful. We can avoid gluttony by practicing occasional fasting.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Exercise 2:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				When we love one another, we love God’s creation and our neighbors. We cannot fully love God, without loving everything that comes from Him, including creation and our neighbors.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				We are each body and spirit. In order to love our neighbor, we must show compassionate care for both their body and spirit.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				I probably wouldn’t be very happy. I might feel disrespected or as-if I was just a source of income for the hospital/doctor. If a doctor takes the time to have a real conversation with a patient rather than rushing through a visit, this can help to fulfill the spiritual needs to companionship that the patient has.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Picking up garbage along a hiking trail can help the next visitor more fully enjoy the beauty of God’s creation. Throwing away toxic chemicals can lead to them entering bodies of water that people swim in or get their drinking water from. This can lead to health problems for your neighbor.
