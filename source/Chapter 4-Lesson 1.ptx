		<term>Sections 1: Atoms and subatomic particles</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		All chemicals are made up of elements that are combined together. The smallest unit of an element that possesses the properties of that element is called an <term>atom</term><fn>	<p>
		The smallest unit of an element.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> Atoms are incredibly small with sizes of approximately 0.1 nm. Numerous discoveries in physics and chemistry in the late 1800s and early 1900s revealed to scientists that there are smaller components that make up atoms which are called <term>subatomic particles</term><fn>	<p>
		Particles that make up an atom
	</p></fn><term>.</term> The first particle to be discovered was the <term>electron</term><fn>	<p>
		A negatively charged particle found in the electron cloud of an atom. They have mass, but their mass is often rounded to 0 amu.
	</p></fn>. Scientists showed that electrons could be moved by electric fields, and this property was called charge. The charge of an electron was assigned a value of -1, with the understanding that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. Electrons were also found to have mass, but only a tiny percentage of the mass of an atom. Because of this, the mass of an electron is often rounded to 0 <term>atomic mass units (amu)</term><fn>	<p>
		Atomic mass units are units of mass that are used for very small masses like the mass of an atom.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> Other important observations about electrons were that electrons could be deflected by atoms, implying that the outer part of atoms has a negative charge. This, coupled with the observation that electrons could be removed from atoms relatively easily, lead to our current understanding that electrons exist on the outside of atoms.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next particle to be discovered were <term>protons</term><fn>	<p>
		Positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of approximately 1 amu.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> Scientists learned that protons had considerably more mass than electrons and were assigned a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (atomic mass units are a relative scale of masses that are used primarily to describe the mass of subatomic particles). Additionally, protons were shown to have a charge of +1. Protons thus attract electrons and help to hold electrons in atoms. Additionally, it was revealed that when atoms are bombarded with positively charged particles similar to protons, that they often just passed through the atom and were only occasionally deflected. This was very different behavior than was observed for electrons. This lead to the understanding that protons occur in a small part of the atom near its center, called the <term>nucleus</term><fn>	<p>
		The small dense collection of protons and neutrons that is found at the center of an atom
	</p></fn>. Later experiments showed that the nucleus of an atom has protons and another subatomic particle called a <term>neutron</term><fn>	<p>
		An uncharged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of approximately 1 amu.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> Neutrons have similar masses as protons (approximately 1 amu) but do not have any charge.

	<p>
		<term>Section 2: Atomic number and mass number</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		To describe the number of subatomic particles in an atom, chemists use two different numbers, atomic number and mass number. <term>Atomic number</term><fn>	<p>
		The number of protons in an atom.
	</p></fn> is ALWAYS equal to the number of protons in an atom. If the atom has a net charge of zero, then the atomic number will also be equal to the number of electrons. Every atom of a given element will ALWAYS have the same atomic number. The atomic number is also unique for each atom; no two elements have the same atomic number. Thus different elements can be distinguished by their number of protons.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <term>mass number</term><fn>	<p>
		The sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom.
	</p></fn> of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Since protons and neutrons both have masses of approximately 1 amu, and electrons have masses of approximately 0 amu, only the protons and neutrons are counted for the mass number. For a given element, every atom will have the same number of protons, as stated in the paragraph above. However, atoms of the same element may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that have different masses (and thus different numbers of neutrons) are called <term>isotopes</term><fn>	<p>
		Atoms of an element that have different mass numbers
	</p></fn><term>.</term> Isotopes are important in chemistry and physics not just because they have different masses, but because they may have different properties. For instance, some isotopes of an element may be stable while others may undergo radioactive decay (Chapter 5). Isotopes are often specified in one of three ways:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				By writing the element name followed by a hyphen and then the mass number (ex. carbon-14)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				By writing the mass number as a superscript prior to the element symbol (ex. <sup>14</sup>C).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				By writing the mass number as a superscript prior to the element symbol along with the atomic number as a subscript prior to the element symbol (ex. <m>_{6}^{14}C</m>)
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>

	<p>
		<term>Section 3: Periodic table of elements</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Since each atom has its own atomic number, we can arrange the elements in order of increasing atomic number. If this is done AND atoms with similar reactivity properties are placed in the same column, then the result is the modern periodic table. The periodic table was first introduced by Dmitri Mendeleev in the mid 1800s. He arranged elements by increasing mass (rather than by atomic number) and also strove to group elements with similar reactivities (similar to our current periodic table). One of the most impressive findings of his initial periodic table was that is predicted the existence of elements that were not yet known to chemists, but that are known now. Additionally, the position of elements within the periodic table allows scientists to predict how atoms will behave in certain reactions. Finally, the periodic table was useful in showing that there are patterns that predict when certain reactivity properties will occur. This pattern would later prove valuable in helping chemists understand the subatomic structural details of atoms and how it relates to reactivity (more on this in later chapters).
	</p>

	<p>
		The periodic table contains information about every known element in squares throughout the table. The number at the top of the square is the atomic number of the element. The element name and element symbol are often given below the atomic number. In many cases, the element symbol is similar to the element name in English. In other cases, the element symbol reflects the Latin name of the element (ex. Iron’s symbol is Fe, reflecting the name ferrum in Latin). Below the element symbol is another number called the atomic mass, which will be covered in the next section. It is important to be able to distinguish between the atomic mass of an element and the mass number of an isotope.
	</p>

	<p>
		The elements within the periodic table are organized into rows and columns. The rows are called <term>periods</term><fn>	<p>
		Rows in the periodic table
	</p></fn> and the columns are called <term>groups</term><fn>	<p>
		Columns in the periodic table. Elements in the same group usually have similar chemical and physical properties.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> The periods and numbers are assigned numbers. The groups in the periodic table are numbered 1-18 left to right but are sometimes numbered in a different way in which the 8 tall column are numbered followed by the letter A, thus skipping over the shorter columns. So group 1 is also called 1A, group 2 is called 2A, and group 13 (the next tall column) is also known as group 3A. The tall “A” columns in the periodic table are referred to as the main group elements. The short columns that separate groups 2A and 3A are referred to as the transition metals. Below the periodic table are two additional rows of elements called the lanthanides and actinides, respectively. These rows would occur between groups 2 and 3 in the periodic table, but are often dropped to the bottom to save space and make sure that the periodic table isn’t too long. Since the elements in the lanthanides and actinides are relatively rare, we will not be discussing them much in this class.
