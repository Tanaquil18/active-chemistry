	<p>
		At the bottom of a square in the periodic table is the value of the <term>atomic mass</term><fn>	<p>
		The weighted average of the masses of the isotopes found in nature. The weighting is based on the natural abundance of each isotope.
	</p></fn> in units of amu. Look at this number for carbon (12.011). This number is clearly different than the mass number since it is not an integer. However the calculation used to determine the atomic mass of an element relies on the mass numbers of the naturally occurring isotopes. To calculate atomic mass, we calculate the <term>weighted average</term><fn>	<p>
		A way of averaging that takes into account how frequently a value occurs in the sampling.
	</p></fn> of the various isotopes that are found in nature.
	</p>

	<p>
		What is a weighted average? It’s a way of averaging that takes into account how frequently each isotope occurs in nature. For instance, if a class of 5 students had the following exam scores: 90, 80, 90, 90, 90 you wouldn’t simply average 80 and 90 to find the average. Instead you would add up each of the numbers (90+80+90+90+90=440) and then divide by 5. Another way of doing this is to weight each of the scores by writing how frequently it occurs:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{80 + 4 \times 90}{5} = 88</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Since 90 occurred 4 times we can multiply it by 4 and then add 80 rather than adding 90 four times. Alternatively, you could reach the same result by knowing that 20% of the class got an 80 and 80% of the class scored a 90. To use the percentages, we can assume that we have any class size, but assuming a class size of 100 people makes the calculation easiest. If we had 100 students in the class, then 20 of them would have a score of 80 and 80 of them would have a score of 90. We would multiply each score by the values of these percentages and then divide the result by the number of students that we assumed were in the class (100). The calculation would look like this and gives the exact same result:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{80 \times 20 + 90 \times 80}{100} = 88</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		When we calculate the atomic mass, we do a similar thing. Similar to the example above we have percent abundances for each element (ex. 20% of the isotope in the name have a certain mass number). To use percentages in a weighted average we assume that if we had 100 isotopes that that the value of the percentage is how many isotopes would have that mass. If we multiply each mass number by its percent occurrence, add then together, and then divide by 100, then we get the atomic mass. See below:

		We calculate that atomic mass by taking each mass number and multiplying it by the number of isotopes of that mass that we’d expect in a group of 100 isotopes. After that we add the masses together and then divide by the total number of isotopes that we’re averaging (100).

		<term>Section 2: Electron shells</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		We’ve learned that electrons can be found in atoms and that they exist outside of the nucleus. This fact makes them the most important subatomic particle when we’re trying to understand the reactivity properties of an atom. Why? If two atoms are going to interact with one another, their electrons are going to be the type of subatomic particle that will first interact between the atoms. In order to be able to make sense of the reactivity properties of atoms, we need to understand how electrons are arranged around an atom.
	</p>

	<p>
		Niels Bohr came up with the first model of the atom that sought to explain where the atoms are around the nucleus. His model sought to do two things: 1. To explain why negatively charged electrons don’t fall into the positively charge nucleus and 2. why hydrogen is able to emit light with very specific amounts of energy. His model proposed the idea that the electrons in an atom are placed into orbits around the nucleus (similar to satellites around Earth). If the electrons move fast enough, then they will never fall into the nucleus. Also, if we know the mass of an electron and its velocity we can calculate the amount of energy that an electron has in its orbit. Electrons in different orbits would have different velocities and thus different amounts of energy. The observation that hydrogen emits light with specific energies could be explained if electrons hopped from one orbit to another, giving off their excess energy as light.

		How many electrons can each shell hold? Lower shell numbers are closer to the nucleus, and thus have less room for electrons than higher numbered shells. Each shell is capable of holding a certain number of electrons, and this is given by the equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\# electrons = 2 \times (shell\ number)^{2}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		So the first shell can hold <m>2 \times (1)^{2} = 2\ electrons</m>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> can hold <m>2 \times (2)^{2} = 8\ electrons</m>, and so on.

		<term>Section 3: Orbitals</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		It was later revealed that the Bohr model was sufficient in some ways. Electron shells could explain the structure of a hydrogen atom, but failed to explain the experimental data for any other element. The reason for this is that once you have more than one electron, they begin to interact with one another. This necessitated the inclusion of <term>orbitals</term><fn>	<p>
		Regions of an atom where there is a high probability of finding an electron
	</p></fn><term>,</term> which are regions within a shell that electrons can occupy. The idea of electron shells didn’t go away; instead the theory was modified to say that shells are more complex than originally thought. Orbitals exist within each shell and define regions where electrons are likely to be.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are different types of orbitals, and each type is a set of different shapes that electrons can occupy. The orbital sets are given the letters: s, p, d, and f (see the following link to see their shapes: <url href="https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Atomic-Orbital.jpg">https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Atomic-Orbital.jpg</url>). S-orbitals are spherical in shape and occur around the nucleus. P-orbitals come in sets of 3, and each member of the set looks like a dumbbell or infinity symbol. D-orbitals come in sets of 5, with most of them looking like clovers. F-orbitals come in sets of 7 and have even more complicated shapes. You should be able to recognize and draw the s, p, and d orbital shapes and you should know how many come in a set.
	</p>

	<p>
		So how do orbitals relate to shells? First of all, you need to know that orbitals can hold 2 electrons. The s-orbital comes in groups of 1, and thus that single orbital in the set can hold 2 electrons. Each of the p-orbitals in a set of 3 can hold 2 electrons, for a total of 6 electrons. Each of the d-orbitals holds 2 electrons and since they come in sets of 5, a set of d-orbitals holds 10 electrons. Now let’s go back to the shells. The first shell holds 2 electrons based on the formula given above. The only set of orbitals that can give two electrons is the s-orbital. So the first shell only contains one s-orbital and it is designated as the 1s orbital (meaning first shell s-orbital). The second shell contains 8 electrons. No set of orbitals by itself can give us 8 electrons, but the combination of a set of s-orbitals and p-orbitals can together hold 8 electrons (2 electrons from the s-orbital and 6 from the three p-orbitals). So the 2<sup>nd</sup> shell has a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. In order to get 18 electrons for the third shell, we need a 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and five 3d orbitals. For the fourth shell a 4s orbital, three 4p orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and seven 4f orbitals are required. Hopefully you’re noticing a pattern. The 5<sup>th</sup> shell and up should require additional orbital types, but there are no known elements that require orbitals beyond the f-orbitals. The table below summarizes this information.
