	</p>

	<p>
		Now that we know where we can put electrons in an atom, we can start to fill these orbitals with the number of electrons that an atom has. In general the order that we fill will proceed from the lowest shell number to the highest because lower shell numbers have lower energy than higher shell numbers (making filling them preferable…here’s an analogy, is it easier to put a bowling ball on the floor at the bottom of a set of stairs or to carry it up and put it on the top step…similarly nature prefers lower energy states to higher states.
	</p>

	<p>
		Way number 1 to figure out the filling order:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Make a diagram listing all of the possible orbitals as shown below (one of the exercises will have you practice making this drawing)
			</p>
		</li>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Begin drawing diagonal lines starting at the top. The order that you draw through the diagonal lines is the order that the orbitals get filled

				Figure out the order: 1s&lt;2s&lt;2p&lt;3s&lt;3p&lt;4s&lt;3d&lt;4p&lt;5s&lt;4d&lt;5p&lt;6s…

		Before I show you the other way to find the orbital filling order, it’ll be helpful to start filling these orbitals with electrons. We have to remember that each orbital holds 2 electrons and that s-orbitals come in groups of 1, p’s in groups of 3, d’s in groups of 5, and f’s in groups of 7. This means that s-orbitals hold up to 2 electrons, p’s up to 6, d’s up to 10, and f’s up to 14. We’ll start simple with hydrogen. A neutral hydrogen atom only has one electron (given by it’s atomic number of 1). That electron will be placed in the lowest energy orbital (the 1s). We denote the number of electrons in a set of orbitals with a superscript after the orbital. So hydrogen has the electron configuration <m>1s^{1}</m>. For an atom of helium, we have two electrons. The 1s orbital can hold two electrons, so it’s configuration is <m>1s^{2}</m>. For lithium, we have 3 electrons, this additional electron needs to go into the next lowest orbital so its configuration is <m>1s^{2}2s^{1}</m>. Similarly beryllium is <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}</m>. After this, we have boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon with electron configurations of <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{1}</m>, <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{2}</m>, <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{3}</m>, <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{4},\ 1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{5},</m> and <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}</m> respectively. With larger and larger elements, the electron configurations get longer and longer to write out. Thankfully we have an abbreviated way of accomplishing this which is shown in the box below, along with another way of figuring out the orbital filling order:
	</p>

	<p>
		The position of an element in the periodic table can tell us the orbital and shell numbers that are being filled as shown below:
	</p>

</figure>

	<p>
		Using this diagram we can fill the electron configuration of any atom. In the first row, we’re crossing the s-block, so those electrons go into the 1s orbital. The first two elements in the 2<sup>nd</sup> row will have additional electrons in their 2s orbital (because they are in the s-block) then the next 6 will have their additional electrons put in the 2p orbitals. Next comes 3s and 3p with the elements in the 3<sup>rd</sup> row. In the 4<sup>th</sup> row, we cross the s block (4s), then the d-block (3d; note that the d shell number is always one less than the row number), then the 4p. To abbreviate long electron configurations, the noble-gas shorthand is used. When doing this, we proceed BACKWARDS to the nearest noble gas and write its symbol in brackets to indicate that this element has the same electron configuration as that noble gas, plus the extra orbitals that we’ll soon indicate. We then add on the additional orbitals and electrons from the row that the element we’re interested is in. So for potassium (K), if we back up to the nearest noble gas, we find argon. The additional electrons for potassium are in the 4<sup>th</sup> row. There is only 1 additional electron in the s-block so the electron configuration is <m>\lbrack Ar\rbrack 4s^{1}</m>. Similarly, for cadmium, we’d back up to find krypton. The additional electrons (12 of them) are in the 5<sup>th</sup> row and we have to cross the s and d blocks. So the electron configuration would be <m>\lbrack Kr\rbrack 5s^{2}4d^{10}</m>.

		<term>Section 2: Valence electrons</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The noble gas shorthand does a good job of emphasizing the electrons that are in the outermost shell (highest number shell) of the atom. These electrons are called <term>valence electrons</term><fn>	<p>
		Electrons that are in the outermost (or highest energy) electron shell of an atom.
	</p></fn>. They are very important because if two atoms come together to react with one another, the outer most electrons are the ones that are going to be controlling how they interact. We can find the number of electrons from the electron configuration quite easily. Take carbon for example. Its electron configuration is <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{2}</m> or <m>\lbrack He\rbrack 2s^{2}2p^{2}</m>. There are 4 electrons in the 2<sup>nd</sup> shell (the highest numbered shell for carbon), so it has 4 valence electrons. Silicon, which is in the same group and has similar reactivity properties has the electron configuration <m>\lbrack Ne\rbrack 3s^{2}3p^{2}</m> and thus also has 4 valence electrons. We can figure out the number of valence electrons from the electron configuration, but we can figure them out even easier for the main group elements (ie. those elements in the tall columns) by simply looking at the main group number. Carbon is in group 4A and thus has 4 valence electrons. Fluorine is in group 7A and thus has 7 valence electrons.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus, every element in a particular group (at least in the main group; we won’t worry about the transition metals for this part) of the periodic table will have the same number of valence electrons. Recall that elements in the same group in the periodic table have similar chemical and physical properties. The reason for this is that every element in a group has the name number of valence electrons. This can also highlight particularly stable and unstable arrangements of electrons. Answer the exercise questions to shed some light on this.
