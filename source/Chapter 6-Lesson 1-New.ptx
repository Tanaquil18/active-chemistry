		<term>Section 1: Ionic compounds</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		To review, compounds are pure substances that consist of atoms of various elements that are joined together in a specific ratio. There are two different classes of compounds: ionic compounds and covalent/molecular compounds. In this section, we’ll be learning about the differences between ionic compounds and covalent compounds. What distinguishes ionic compounds from covalent/molecular compounds is the way in which the atoms are joined together.
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Ionic compounds</term> are made up of <term>ions</term> that are joined together by <term>electrostatic forces</term>. Ions are particles that have a net charge, either a positive or a negative charge. Ions can either be positively charged (<term>cations</term>) or negatively charges (<term>anions</term>). Additionally, ions can either consist of one atom (a monoatomic ion) or of several atoms that are joined together to form a larger charged unit (a polyatomic ion). An ionic compound consists of cations and anions that are held together because their opposite charges attract one another (electrostatic forces).
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Covalent compounds</term> (also known as <term>molecular compounds</term>) are formed from atoms that are joined together by sharing electrons. Ionic compounds always consist of multiple ions, which are separate units that are attracted to one another. In contrast, covalent compounds consist of a single unit that is comprised of all of the component atoms. Within this unit, the atoms are held together by the sharing of electrons. This unit of a covalent compound is called a <term>molecule</term>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ionic compounds generally (but not always…we’ll learn about the exceptions later) consist of a metal and one or more non-metals. Covalent compounds, on the other hand, consist exclusively of non-metals. This can be useful in allowing us to identify whether a compound is an ionic or covalent compound. Recall that metals can be found on the left side of the periodic table whereas non-metals can be found exclusively on the upper right. Thus, if a compound contains a metal, we can be confident that it is an ionic compound. If a compound doesn’t contain a metal, it is usually a covalent compound (again, we’ll learn about exceptions to this in a later section).
	</p>

	<p>
		These atomic-level differences between ionic and covalent compounds lead to very different physical properties. The physical properties that we’ll be learning about are melting point and behavior in solution. In general, ionic compounds have much higher melting points than covalent compounds. In a solid ionic compound, the ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces as we learned above. In a solid covalent compound, the various molecules are themselves held together, but by much weaker <term>intermolecular forces</term>. We’ll discuss intermolecular forces in much more detail later in this chapter. Since the forces that hold together ions in an ionic compound are much stronger than the intermolecular forces that hold together molecules in a covalent compound, more energy is required to break the bonds in an ionic compound. This results in a higher melting point.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a big difference between ionic and covalent compounds when it comes to how they can dissolve in water to form a solution. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the electrostatic interactions between the ions are replaced by interactions between the ions and water. Basically, the ions that make up the ionic compound separate from one another and get surrounded by water molecules. When covalent compounds dissolve in water, they remain as intact molecules. Each molecule is surrounded by water molecules similar to what is seen for an ionic compound. The difference is that molecules remain intact whereas the ions that make up ionic compounds separate from one another.

		<term>Section 2: Ions</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this section, we’ll be learning about how atoms form ions. First of all, what is an ion. We’ve learned that an ion is a species that is charged. So how does it get its charge? It does so by having extra electrons or by lacking electrons. If an atom has more electrons than protons, then its charge will be negative and it will be an anion. If an atom has fewer electrons than protons, then the atom will be positively charges, and it will be a cation. Importantly, the number of protons will NEVER change for an element. Ions are created by either adding or removing electrons.
	</p>

	<p>
		Why do some atoms gain electrons whereas other atoms lose them? Why do some gain/lose a single electron whereas others gain/lose multiple? To understand this, we need to revisit electron configurations. The most stable elements on the periodic table are the noble gases. Why are they so stable? It turns out that they are stable because their orbitals are either completely filled or completely empty! For instance, the electron configuration of helium is <m>1s^{2}</m> and the electron configuration of neon is <m>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}</m> (recall that a set of s-orbitals hold 2 electrons, a set of p orbitals can hold 6…etc.). For all of the noble gases except helium, they have 8 <term>valence electrons</term> (helium has 2). Thus the most stable electron configurations will have 8 valence electrons, something known as the <term>octet rule</term>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For many elements, they form ions in order to get an electron configuration that is the same as a noble gas. For instance, if a group 1 metal loses a single electron, then it will have the same electron configuration as a noble gas (ex. the electron configuration of sodium is <m>\lbrack Ne\rbrack 3s^{1}</m> and if it loses its outermost valence electron then its electron configuration will simply be <m>\lbrack Ne\rbrack 3s^{0}</m> or simply <m>\lbrack Ne\rbrack</m>). Because of this, group 1 metals tend to lose a single electron to form ions. Elements in group 2 tend to lose 2 electrons, because this will give them an electron configuration that is the same as a noble gas as well. On the other side of the periodic table, the halogens (group 17 or 7A) have electron configurations that are a single electron away from resembling a noble gas. In order for them to reach a noble gas configuration, they have to GAIN one electron. As a result they’ll form negatively charged anions. Elements in group 16 will likewise gain two electrons to achieve a noble gas electron configuration.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of the elements in the periodic table have predictable charges in ionic compounds. The metals in group 1 will always have a +1 charge. The metals in group 2 will always have a +2 charge. Aluminum will likewise always have a +3 charge. The halogens (group 17 or 7A) will always for anions with a -1 charge. The non-metals in group 16 (6A) will gain two electrons to form -2 anions. The non-metals in group 15 (5A), nitrogen and phosphorus, can gain 3 electrons to form -3 anions. Hydrogen is a rather unique element, in that it can lose one electron (forming a +1 ion with completely empty orbitals) or gain an electron to resemble helium (forming a -1 anion).

		<term>Section 3: Simple ionic compounds</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Ionic compounds are formed by combining cations and anions. When they are combined, they must do so in such a way that the total positive charge is equal to the total negative charge. Sometimes this is simple. For instance a <m>Na^{+}</m> ion can be combined with a <m>Cl^{-}</m> ion in a 1:1 ratio because the +1 charge from the sodium balances the -1 charge from the chlorine. There would therefore be one of each ion in the <term>chemical formula</term> for this compound, and we’d write it simply as <m>NaCl</m> (note: if there’s one of an element in a chemical formula the 1 is not written). On the other hand, if we wanted to make an ionic compound by joining a <m>Ca^{2 +}</m> ion with a <m>Cl^{-}</m> ion, then we’d require 2 <m>Cl^{-}</m> ions to balance the +2 charge on the calcium ion. Thus, they’d combine to form the compound <m>CaCl_{2}</m> (the number of ions is written as a subscript). <em>Also, note that when we write the chemical formula of an ionic compound that we don’t include the charges of the ions!</em>
	</p>

	<p>
		Ionic compounds can be specified by their chemical formula (as covered above) or by their name. How do we name ionic compounds? Naming ionic compounds is easy. They consist of two separate words. The first word is the name of the cation, and the second word is the name of the anion. For simple ionic compounds that have metal cations with known charges, naming the cation is easy…it’s simply the name of that metal. The name of the anion is more complex. To name the anion, we start with the name of the element, but we delete the ending of the name and replace it with -ide. See the table below:
	</p>

	<table>

			<cell halign="left">Element</cell>

	</table>

	<p>
		Thus the name of <m>NaCl</m> is sodium chloride and <m>CaBr_{2}</m> would be calcium bromide. When we’re naming ionic compounds, we NEVER use prefixes to indicate the number of ions present. The number of ions is implied by our knowledge about the ions themselves and their charges. To illustrate this, lets figure out the chemical formula for magnesium oxide. We know that this compound consists of magnesium and oxygen. Based on their locations in the periodic table, we can conclude that magnesium would form a +2 ion and that oxygen would form a -2 ion. In order to get the positive and negative charges to balance, we’d need a 1:1 ratio so the correct formula would simply be <m>MgO</m>.
