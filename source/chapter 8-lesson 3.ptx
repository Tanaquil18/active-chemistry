		<term>Ideal Gas Law and Chemical Reactions</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The Ideal Gas Law can also be used in calculations involving chemical reactions. The Ideal Gas Law can be used to determine the number of moles of reactants or to determine the pressure/volume/temperature of the products from the number of moles. This is displayed in the figure below. Also, please see the sample calculation shown below.

		<term>Partial Pressures and Dalton’s Law</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		All of the gas laws that we’ve dealt with thus far assume that we are dealing with a pure sample of one gas. What is we’re dealing with a mixture of gases, like air? If we have a mixture of gases in a container, then we can measure the volume of the mixture and its temperature and those values will apply to each of the individual gases within the mixture as well, because each of the individual gases will occupy the entirety of the volume and have the same amount of kinetic energy as all of the other gases in the mixture. However, the gas particles of an individual gas in a mixture of gases will NOT have the same pressure as the mixture. This is because each individual gas is impacting the sides of the container with only a portion of the total pressure being exerted by the mixture itself. We have a term for the amount of pressure that an individual gas exerts within a mixture and it is called the <term>partial pressure</term> of that gas.
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Dalton’s Law</term> deals with the partial pressure of gases within a mixture, and it’s an intuitive law when you think about it. Daltons law says the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases that make up the mixture. This is because each individual gas impacts the sides of the container with a certain force. The total force is simply the sum of the forces of each of the gases. Since they are all impacting the same surface area, the pressures should also be additive. Dalton’s Law is summarized by the following formula:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3}\ldots</me>
