		<term>Solutions with covalent vs. ionic compounds</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When we dissolve one substance into another to make a homogeneous mixture, we’ve made a <term>solution</term>. The substance that there is less of is called the <term>solute</term> and the substance that there is more of is called the <term>solvent</term>. When discussing preparing a solution, we generally state that the solute is dissolved in the solvent (ex. sodium chloride is dissolved into water—the sodium chloride is the solute and water is the solvent). For the most part in this course, we’re going to be considering cases where water is the solvent.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some compounds are capable of dissolving in water, whereas others cannot. Why is it that some compounds are able to dissolve in water and others are not? There are a few considerations that we need to take into account to completely answer this question. Ultimately, though, a compound will dissolve if the bonds that the compound forms with water are stronger than the bonds that the compound and water both had in their previous state.
	</p>

	<p>
		To understand this, we must first understand what happens when a compound does successfully dissolve in water. <em>If the compound is an ionic compound, then the compound will break apart into its individual ions as we’ve learned previously</em>. Each of these ions will form new bonds with the polar water molecules that surround them. Recall that if a molecule is polar, that it has a partially negatively charged end and a partially positively charged end. Thus the partially negatively charged end of water is attracted to cations from the ionic compound and the partially positively charged end of water is attracted to anions from the ionic compound. These types of interactions are called <term>ion-dipole</term> <term>interactions</term>. <em>Covalent compounds, on the other hand, do NOT break apart when dissolved in water.</em> Instead the covalent compound separates from other identical molecules and forms new bonds with water using the intermolecular forces we learned about previously (dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding, and London dispersion forces).
	</p>

	<p>
		Now that we understand what has to happen to dissolve a compound, let’s draw some parallels to reaction energy diagrams that we’ve learned about in Chapter 7. We saw that we can indicate the energy levels of the reactants and products, and that the transition state separates them. The same is true for a dissolving ‘reaction’ (we usually don’t actually consider this to be a reaction since no new compound forms). In order for our starting compounds (reactants) to dissolve in one another (products), bonds must be broken (transition state) so new bonds can form. If the energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants, then the compound will dissolve because the dissolved state is more stable than the starting point. If the energy of the starting compound and water is lower than the energy of them dissolved together, then the compound will not dissolve because the undissolved state is more stable.

		<term>Solubility and temperature effects</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Solubility</term> is the a term that describes the amount of one compound that can dissolve into water. For instance, at 20 degrees Celsius, the solubility of NaCl is approximately 35g/100g water. This means that 100 g of water can dissolve up to 38 g of sodium chloride. If we try to dissolve 17 g of sodium chloride into 100 g of water, it will dissolve, forming a solution. We could still dissolve more sodium chloride into that solution because it is not yet <term>saturated.</term> A saturated solution is one where the maximum possible amount of solute has dissolved into water. In the example above where we tried to dissolve 17g of sodium chloride into 100 g of water, it was easy to determine that it wasn’t saturated because 17g NaCl/100g water is clearly less than the solubility of 35g NaCl/100g water since the amount of water is the same. However, could we dissolve 17.5 g of NaCl into 43 g of water??? To determine this we want to convert this ratio into one that has 100 g of water in it, allowing us to compare it to the solubility of NaCl in water. We do this as shown below:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
			<p>
		<me>\frac{17.5g\ NaCl}{43\ g\ water} = \frac{x}{100g\ water}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>x = 40.7\ g\ NaCl</me>
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		Since 40.7 g is more than the solubility of 35g of NaCl in 100 g of water, this amount of sodium chloride would not completely dissolve and we’d end up with a saturated solution with some undissolved solid sodium chloride left over.
	</p>

	<p>
		Changing the temperature often has an impact on how much of a compound can dissolve in water. The effect differs depending on whether the compound that is being dissolved is a solid or a gas. <em>For most solids, the solubility of a solid increases as the temperature increases.</em> Thus we can dissolve more solute at higher temperatures. If a saturated solution is prepared at high temperatures and the temperature is then decreased, we can end up in a situation where we have more solid dissolved in water than the solubility limit allows for and this is called a <term>supersaturated solution</term>. These solutions are unstable and will spontaneously eject solid from the solution causing it to crystallize and reform the solid.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>The solubility of gases, on the other hand, decreases with increasing temperature</em>. As the temperature rises, less gas can remain dissolved in water. This is part of the reason why opened soda remains carbonated in the refrigerator but rapidly goes flat if kept warm.
