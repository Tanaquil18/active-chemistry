		<em><term>Reaction energetics: kinetics and thermodynamics</term></em>
	</p>

	<p>
		In chemistry, it is often very helpful to know how fast reactions occur. Within our bodies, chemical reactions drive a wide range of different processes ranging from DNA replication, to movement, to nerve firing. Each of these processes must be carefully controlled. For instance, a nerve firing too quickly could disrupt muscle contractions leading to seizures or cardiac arrest. So in chemistry, what controls the speed of a reaction? The answer is that both the speed and extent of a reaction are controlled by the energetics of that reaction. Some reactions that we regard as impossible (ex. helium, a noble gas, reacting with oxygen) aren’t actually impossible…they’d just require a LOT of energy in order to make them occur. Energy similarly controls the speed of a chemical reaction.
	</p>

	<p>
		How are we to understand the energetics of chemical reactions? Reaction energy diagrams can be very useful in this. A reaction energy diagram displays the energy level of the reactants and products of a reaction as well as the energy of the <term>transition state.</term> The transition state is a point that is midway between reactants and products. In most chemical reactions, bonds have to be broken before new bonds can form. The transition state generally represents a point at which the old bonds have been broken and the atoms are positioned so that new bonds can form (see the figure below that depicts the formation <image source='media/image1.png'/>of water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas).
	</p>

	<p>
		Reaction energy diagrams, like the one shown below, depict the difference between the energy level of the reactants and the transition state, a quantity known as the <term>activation energy</term> of the reaction. Activation energy is directly proportional to the speed or kinetics of a reaction. The higher the activation energy, the slower the reaction; the lower the activation energy, the faster the reaction. This is because as the activation energy of a reaction increases, it becomes less and less probable that a given reactant molecule will have enough energy to transform from reactants into products. The less likely this is, the slower the reaction proceeds. Reactions can be sped up by adding in more energy (ie. by increasing the temperature) or by adding in <term>catalysts</term>. A catalyst is a substance that is able to speed up a reaction by decreasing the energy of the transition state. Importantly, a catalyst does this without being consumed by the reaction. A catalyst also does not affect the energies of the reactants or products.
	</p>

	<p>
		Reaction energy diagrams also depict the relative energies of the reactants and products. The relationship between the reactants and products will determine which one is favored in the reaction, with nature always favoring the one that has the lowest energy (ie. the one that is the most stable). Reactions where the products are lower in energy than the reactants are called <term>exergonic reactions</term>. These reactions will proceed in the forward direction and will release energy. Reactions where the reactants are lower in energy than the products are called <term>endergonic reactions.</term> In those reactions, the reaction would tend to proceed in the reverse direction, creating more reactants from the products. In order to get the reaction to proceed in the forward direction, energy would have to be put into the reaction, often by applying heat. This is similar to how you have to expend energy to push an object uphill. <em>It is important to understand that whether a reaction is exergonic or endergonic predicts the directionality of a reaction and whether or not there will be more reactants or products when the reaction finishes. It does NOT determine how fast a reaction occurs; that is only determined by the activation energy.</em>

		<em><term>Reaction equilibrium and Le Chatelier’s principle</term></em>
	</p>

	<p>
		Our discussion of reaction energy diagrams and energetics revealed that chemical reactions are reversible. Chemical reactions, once started proceed both in the forward and reverse directions, however it’s often the case that one direction is preferred over the other. For the purposes of this discussion, let’s assume that the forward direction is preferred over the reverse direction (ie. the reaction is exergonic). The net reaction initially proceeds in the forward direction because the forward reaction is occurring faster than the reverse reaction. However, as time goes on, the reactants begin to run out, slowing down the forward reaction, while the reverse reaction begins to speed up. The reaction finally stops once it reaches <term>equilibrium.</term> At this point, the amount of reactants and products is no longer changing because the speed of the forward reaction is equal to the speed of the reverse reaction. Once reactions reach equilibrium, the net reaction can once again proceed (either in the forward or reverse direction) if the equilibrium is disturbed. We can predict the outcome of this disturbance by applying <term>Le Chatelier’s principle</term>. Le Chatelier’s principle states that a reaction at equilibrium will respond to changes by trying to restore the equilibrium. This can be easily illustrated by viewing chemical reactions as a seesaw. A reaction at equilibrium can be thought of as a balanced seesaw; once a disturbance occurs, then the balance of the seesaw is broken. In order to restore the equilibrium, reactants must either convert to products or products must convert to reactants until the balance is once again restored.
