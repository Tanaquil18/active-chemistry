		<term>Conjugate acid/base pairs</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The dissociation of an acid or base is a reversible reaction (excepting strong acids and bases). If acetic acid functions as an acid, donating its H<sup>+</sup> to something else, then acetate results as a product. In the reverse reaction, that acetate ion would accept an H<sup>+</sup> once again becoming acetic acid. Thus acetate would be functioning as a base. Every acid produces a base after donating its H<sup>+</sup>. Likewise, every base produces an acid after accepting an H<sup>+</sup>, because the reverse reaction would have the product donating the H<sup>+</sup> that the base form had just received.
	</p>

	<p>
		Every acid will therefore form a base in a chemical reaction. This is called the <term>conjugate base</term> of that acid. Together they form a <term>conjugate acid-base pair</term>, two molecules whose only difference is the presence or absence of an H<sup>+</sup>. Likewise every base will form a <term>conjugate acid</term> after accepting an H<sup>+</sup> in a reaction, and they together for a conjugate acid-base pair.
	</p>

	<p>
		What about the chemical structure of a molecule make it into an acid or a base? Why is CH<sub>4</sub> not an acid while HCl is? The truth is that every compound with a hydrogen atom is potentially an acid, but some of them are so weak that we don’t consider them to be an acid (CH<sub>4</sub> is an example of this). The strength of an acid is related to the stability of its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is very stable, then it is easy for the acid to lose an H<sup>+</sup> and form its conjugate base. If the conjugate base is an anion that we’ve seen before (monoatomic or polyatomic), then it’s stable. In the case of <m>CH_{4}</m>, its conjugate base would be <m>CH_{3}^{-}</m>. This is unstable because it would put a negative charge on a carbon atom, something we’ve never seen before (reminder: carbon isn’t very electronegative and thus wouldn’t like to have excess electrons). Negative charges can exist on highly electronegative elements such as the halogens and oxygen. If a molecule has a positive charge and has a hydrogen atom, it can often act as an acid since losing the H<sup>+</sup> can stabilize the molecule by also removing the positive charge (ex. <m>NH_{4}^{+}\ is\ an\ acid\ because\ losing\ H^{+}\ results\ in\ NH_{3}\ which\ is\ stable)</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		In order for a molecule to act as a base, the molecule must have a lone pair of electrons in order to form a new bond with the H<sup>+</sup> that it would accept. In addition, the conjugate acid must be stable. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms often have lone pairs of electrons and are especially good at accepting H<sup>+</sup>. Also, molecules that have a negative charge and lone pairs of electrons are often good bases because if they accept an H<sup>+</sup>, the negative charge will get neutralized (ex. <m>OH^{-}\ is\ a\ good\ base\ because\ if\ it\ accepts\ an\ H^{+}\ the\ conjugate\ acid\ is\ water,\ which\ is\ very\ stable</m>).

		<term>Water as an acid and base</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		We already learned that acids donate H<sup>+</sup> or increase the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in solution. This is a bit of an oversimplification. In water, H<sup>+</sup> essentially doesn’t exist, because it very rapidly undergoes a reaction with water that is shown below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>H^{+} + H_{2}O \rightarrow H_{3}O^{+}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is a polyatomic ion called <term>hydronium ion</term>. Chemists will typically use H+ and H3O+ interchangeably, so just be aware that H<sup>+</sup> really means H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> if the acid is in water. Another term to be aware of is that H<sup>+</sup> is sometimes called a “proton”. Why? Well most hydrogen atoms have 1 proton, no neutrons, and 1 electron…take away the electron to form H<sup>+</sup> and all you have leftover is 1 proton.
	</p>

	<p>
		We’ve discussed the definition of an acid and a base and have seen examples of what happens when acids or bases are mixed with water. In this section, we’re going to have a bit more formal treatment of what happens when an acid or base is mixed with water. See the chart below:

	<p>
		<em>Note: when nitrogen containing bases are mixed with water, the product is a salt with hydroxide. The base accepts a proton from water and forms an ionic compound with the leftover hydroxide as shown in the table above and the additional reactions below:</em>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>NH_{2}CH_{3}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) \rightarrow NH_{3}CH_{3}^{+}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq) \rightarrow NH_{3}CH_{3}OH(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		So nitrogen containing bases that are aqueous can be written as salts with hydroxide. However, they are weak bases so the reactant form also remains. Either form is appropriate to write as shown in the table below:

	<p>
		Since water can act both as an acid and a base, we can write the following reaction where one water is an acid and another is a base. This reaction is continually happening in a sample of liquid water:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>H_{2}O + H_{2}O \rightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + OH^{-}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		So in a sample of water, there is always some hydronium ion and some hydroxide ion. If water is neutral (ie. not acidic or basic), then the concentration of hydroxide and hydronium ions are equal. If water is acidic (for instance, if an acid is added to water), then extra hydronium ion has been produced and the amount of hydronium ion exceeds the amount of hydroxide ion. If the water is basic, (for instance, if a base is added to water), then extra hydroxide ions have been produced and the amount of hydroxide exceeds the amount of hydronium ions. There is an inverse relationship between the amount of hydroxide and hydronium ions in solution. If we multiply their concentrations (measured in molarity), we get a constant, K<sub>w</sub>, which has a value of 1x10<sup>-14</sup> at 25<sup>o</sup>C. This is shown by the equation below. In the equation, the brackets indicate that these are the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide, measured in molarity. <em>Note: it is crucial that you use the concentrations in molarity and not any other unit for this calculation.</em> K<sub>w</sub> is a unitless value (even though it seems like it should have units of M<sup>2</sup>) but the reason why is beyond the scope of this course.
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack \times \left\lbrack OH^{-} \right\rbrack = 1 \times 10^{- 14} = K_{w}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This equation can be used to find the concentration of hydroxide or hydronium ion, if we’re given the concentration of the other one. It can also be used to find the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions in a neutral solution as shown below:
	</p>

	<p>
		Since it’s neutral, <m>\left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack = \lbrack OH^{-}\rbrack</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, <m>\left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack \times \left\lbrack OH^{-} \right\rbrack = 1 \times 10^{- 14}</m> becomes <m>\left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack^{2} = 1 \times 10^{- 14}</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		So <m>\left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{- 14}} = 1 \times 10^{- 7}M</m>
