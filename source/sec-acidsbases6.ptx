	</p>

	<p>
		The other class of reaction that we’ve seen before in this chapter is a neutralization reaction. Here we’ll cover it in more detail. If the neutralization reaction is between a strong acid and strong base, then the products will be water and a salt as shown in the equations below:
	</p>

	<p>
		Chemical equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O(l) + NaCl(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Ionic equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>H^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq) + Na^{+}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O\ (l) + Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Net ionic equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>H^{+}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O(l)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Any neutralization reaction involving a strong acid reacting with a strong base will have an ionic equation of:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>H^{+}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O(l)</me>
	</p>

		<li>
			<p>
				Break the reactants into their ions
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>NH_{3}</m> is a covalent compound and thus won’t break apart into ions. There is no hydroxide it can lose.
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Identify the acid and the base
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						When identifying the acid and the base, H<sup>+</sup> will always be an acid and OH<sup>-</sup> will always be a base (in your class, at least)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						If the acid is a polyatomic ion (ie. one of the polyatomic ions with “hydrogen” in the name, then break off the hydrogen ion (example: <m>HPO_{4}^{2 -}</m> breaks into <m>H^{+}</m> and <m>PO_{4}^{3 -}</m>))
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				React the acid and the base. H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> will combine together (if present) to form water, but in some cases the base may be something other than hydroxide. In those cases, have the hydrogen ion react with whatever other base is present.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Look at what ions you have left over (and what new ion you may have formed)
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Write these ions in the products (if you’re being asked for an ionic equation)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Delete any ions that didn’t change in the reaction (if you’re being asked for a net ionic equation)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Combine the ions together to form an ionic compound (if you’re being asked for the chemical equation)

		To write a neutralization reaction, like we just did above, we first split acid and base into their ions. Then we allowed the acid (H<sup>+</sup>) to react with the base (OH<sup>-</sup>) to form water. This results in ions being left over (the spectator ions). Those ions are
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Combined together to form the chemical equation,
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Left alone as separate ions (to form the ionic equation), or
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Deleted in both the reactants and products to form the net ionic equation
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Neutralization reactions can follow slightly different patterns when the base is NOT hydroxide. For instance, if the base is ammonia (<m>NH_{3}</m>), then we need to first recognize that this is a covalent compound, not an ionic compound. Thus it won’t split into ions in the first step. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		If we react <m>NaHSO_{4}(aq)</m>with <m>HCl\ (aq)</m>, after step one, we’d have <m>Na^{+}(aq) + H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)</m>. In step 2, the HCl is identified as the acid since it has an H<sup>+</sup> ion; therefore the sodium dihydrogen phosphate must be the base. At this point the acidic <m>H^{+}</m>ion will react with the basic <m>H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}</m> to form <m>H_{3}PO_{4}</m>. This leaves a left over <m>Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq).</m> We can then write the equation in the following ways:
	</p>

	<p>
		Ionic equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>Na^{+}(aq) + H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq) \rightarrow H_{3}PO_{4}(aq) + Na^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Net ionic equation (get rid of the spectator ions):
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) \rightarrow H_{3}PO_{4}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Chemical equation (combine the ions in the products together to make a compound):
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>NaH_{2}PO_{4}(aq) + HCl(aq) \rightarrow H_{3}PO_{4}(aq) + NaCl(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		If we react <m>NH_{3}(aq)\ </m>with <m>HCl\ (aq)</m>, after step one, we’d have <m>NH_{3}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)</m>. At this point the acidic <m>H^{+}</m>ion will react with the basic <m>NH_{3}</m> to form <m>NH_{4}^{+}</m>. The product would then contain <m>NH_{4}^{+}\ (aq)</m> and the left over <m>Cl^{-}(aq).</m> We can then write the equation in the following ways:
	</p>

	<p>
		Ionic equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>NH_{3}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq) \rightarrow NH_{4}^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Net ionic equation (get rid of the chloride spectator ion):
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>NH_{3}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) \rightarrow NH_{4}^{+}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Chemical equation (combine the ions in the products together to make a compound):
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>NH_{3}(aq) + HCl(aq) \rightarrow NH_{4}Cl(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		As a final nuance, we can also have cases where polyatomic ions can act as acids. In those cases, the polyatomic ion will have “hydrogen” as a part of its name. This hydrogen will be lost to the base. Therefore, this polyatomic ion must be broken apart by losing its H<sup>+</sup>. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		Write a chemical equation, ionic equation, and net ionic equation for the reaction between sodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium hydroxide.
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Start by writing the formulas of the compounds and then breaking them apart into their ions
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Sodium hydrogen phosphate: <m>2Na^{+}(aq)\ and\ HPO_{4}^{2 -}(aq)</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Potassium hydroxide: <m>K^{+}(aq)\ and\ OH^{-}(aq)</m>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				The base is the potassium hydroxide, thus the hydrogen phosphate is acting as an acid. It must be further broken apart into <m>H^{+}</m> and <m>PO_{4}^{3 -}</m>.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				React the acid and the base. In this case we have H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> that will combine to form water. This leaves behind <m>2Na^{+},\ K^{+},</m> and <m>PO_{4}^{3 -}</m>.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				We can now write the ionic equation,
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>K^{+}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq) + 2Na^{+}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) + PO_{4}^{3 -}(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O\ (l) + 2Na^{+}(aq) + K^{+}(aq) + PO_{4}^{3 -}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		net ionic equation,
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>OH^{-}(aq) + H^{+}(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O\ (l)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		and chemical equation
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>KOH(aq) + Na_{2}HPO_{4}(aq) \rightarrow H_{2}O\ (l) + Na_{2}KPO_{4}(aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		(note the strange ionic compound in the product with two different cations…that’s okay!...also their order in the formula doesn’t matter)
