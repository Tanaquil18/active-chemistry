		When scientists describe how acidic or basic a solution is, we could report the concentration of hydronium ion or hydroxide ion. However, because the numbers are so small and usually written in scientific notation, this becomes quite cumbersome. To solve this problem, we instead often transform the concentration of hydronium ion into a pH value using the formula below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>pH = - log(\left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This version of the equation can be used to find the pH value from a concentration of hydronium ion (which MUST be molarity). We can figure out the pH of a neutral solution as shown:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>pH = - \log\left( 1 \times 10^{- 7} \right) = 7</me>
	</p>

	<p>

	</p>

		In some cases, we’ll need to figure out the concentration of hydronium ion from a pH value. This requires rearrangement of the pH equation using algebra skills. The tricky part of this is that we need to ‘undo’ the log function. This is done by taking 10 and raising it to the power of everything on that side of the equation as shown below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>pH = - \log\left( \left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack \right)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>- pH = \log\left( \left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack \right)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>10^{- pH} = 10^{\log\left( \left\lbrack H_{3}O^{+} \right\rbrack \right)}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>10^{- pH} = \lbrack H_{3}O^{+}\rbrack</me>
	</p>
