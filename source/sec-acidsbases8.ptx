    <p>
		<term>Buffers</term> are substances that can be added to water to make the water resistant to changes in pH. A buffer consists of either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. How does this mixture of substances make the solution more resistant to changes in pH?
	</p>

	<p>
		When a strong acid is added to water, it will form hydronium ions and the concentration of the hydronium ions formed will be the same as the concentration of the acid that was just added, because a strong acid completely dissociates upon addition to water. Likewise if a strong base is added to water, it will form the number of hydroxide ions that are contained in that substance that was added, again because a strong base will completely dissociate when added to water. The additional hydronium ion or hydroxide ion will then directly affect the pH of the solution.
	</p>

	<p>
		<image source='media/image1.png'/> When a buffer is present, the solution contains an additional solute that is an acid and another that is a base. These acids and bases are capable of reacting with any base or acid that might get added to the solution, helping to neutralize it. The picture below might help.
	</p>

	<p>
		Every buffer has a <term>buffering capacity</term>. This is the amount of additional acid or base that can be added without exceeding the amount of buffering compounds. So if a buffered solution contains 0.1M weak base and 0.2M of its conjugate acid, then the solution could handle the addition of up to 0.1M hydronium ions before running out of weak base (because the weak base will react with the hydronium ions) and up to 0.2M hydroxide ions (because the hydroxide would react with the conjugate acid). Amounts of hydronium above 0.1M would exceed the buffering capacity of the solution as would addition of more than 0.2M hydroxide ion.
