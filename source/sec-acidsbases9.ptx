	<p>
		An acid base <term><xref ref="def-titration" text="custom">titration</xref></term> is simply a solution reaction that is used to measure the concentration of an acid or base. If we begin with a known volume of solution with an unknown concentration of acid, we can determine its concentration by measuring the number of moles of base that we have to add to neutralize it. The easiest way to do that is to slowly add a solution of base of known concentration to the solution using a burette, which allows us to measure the volume of base needed. If we have the volume and concentration of the base, we can use this to determine the number of moles of base. From there, we can convert moles of base to moles of acid using the balanced chemical equation. If we know moles of acid and its volume (remember we need to know this when we start the titration), then we can divide them to determine the concentration.

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>For the titration in question 1, what was the starting pH of the HCl solution? (Round to the nearest hundredths place)</p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    The previous problem gives you the molarity of the HCl solution.  Since HCl ionizes completely in water, this is the same concentration as the hydronium ion.
