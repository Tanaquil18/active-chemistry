		<term>Section 1: Natural and the Supernatural</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this textbook, I’m going to be assuming that the reader acknowledges the existence of the Christian God and His Son, Jesus Christ. My discussions of faith, science, and ethics will come from the theological tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, but will have a lot in common with other Christian denominations. If there are areas in the text that seem to be at odd with your own personal beliefs, I hope the information contained in here can serve as a starting point for further discussions and debates.
	</p>

	<p>
		Catholics acknowledge Jesus and thus can’t separate their discussions of the <term>natural world</term><fn>	<p>
		Everything that comprises our universe. The natural world are those things that we can see and touch. The natural world can be explored through science.
	</p></fn> from the <term>supernatural</term><fn>	<p>
		Those things that are outside of nature or the laws of physics. We can learn about supernatural things by logical reasoning, philosophy, and theology.
	</p></fn> (bolded text is usually indicating an important term that you SHOULD know the definition of. In this textbook, definitions and extra commentary are provided as footnotes at the bottom of the page). Both the natural and supernatural are components of reality and are interdependent. Catholics acknowledge the existence of God, and thus existence that is beyond nature, in other words, the supernatural. As St. Thomas Aquinas argues in his <em>Summa Theologica</em>, the creation of the natural world presupposes a supernatural cause; nature cannot be the first cause. He argues this at length through the “first mover” argument. In this argument he establishes that the natural world is dependent on God for its existence. This argument goes something like this:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				The natural world is full of motion. Matter moves, time moves, etc.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				All motion must have a prior cause.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Natural things have the potential to move, that is they have <term>potency</term><fn>	<p>
				Potency is the potential to change in some specific way. Natural things have the potency of motion. They aren’t necessarily moving initially, but after the potential of motion is actualized by something else, the thing is now moving.
			</p></fn>. That potential can be realized through the action of some outside cause. Natural things also have <term>actuality</term><fn>	<p>
				Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. For instance, a spark has the ability to cause a paper to start on fire. The spark possesses the property of being able to actualize the fire. The paper possesses the potency of burning.
			</p></fn>, the ability to bring forth potency (ie. natural things can cause other natural things to move). The bringing forth of potency is a change in that thing.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				There must be a first actuality to bring forth all motion. That actuality can’t have potency, otherwise it would have had to be acted on by something else first. We can summarize this by saying that there must be a “first mover”.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				There is a philosophical need for an actor that can actualize motion but remain unchangeable. We call this actor God. God must therefore lack potency (He doesn’t change). Instead, God is pure actuality (<term>Actus Purus</term><fn>	<p>
				Actus Purus means pure actuality. It is something that possesses the property of actuality without any potency. Actus Purus can cause change in other things but cannot be changed itself.
			</p></fn>). He can initiate change or motion but can’t be acted upon or changed by other things.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Actus purus must initiate all motion. Therefore God must have initiate all of nature.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

		After having established the existence of the supernatural in addition to the natural world, many questions arise about the importance of each and the relationship between them (example: miracles). In many ways, the Catholic faith is grounded in the supernatural. God has a supernatural nature and is both the Creator and Redeemer. Humanity is dependent on Him for existence, and the hope for eternal life rests solely in Him. Because of the supremacy of God’s supernatural nature, one might argue that the best thing that each of us can do with our lives is to put all of effort into understanding the supernatural, thus minimizing the importance of the material world. Indeed portions of scripture could be interpreted as saying that this is the approach that Catholics should take. Two examples:
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”</em> 1 John 2:15
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>“’Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?</em> <em>Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?</em> <em>Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?</em> <em>Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.</em> <em>But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.</em> <em>If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?</em> <em>So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’</em> <em>All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</em> <em>But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.”</em> Matthew 6: 25-33.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, should we all study theology and scorn the study of the natural world? Hopefully it is obvious to you that this view is incomplete and thus misguided…but why?

		<em><term>Exercise 1: Natural and the Supernatural</term></em>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Summarize the first mover argument in your own words.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Explain the terms potency, actuality, and Actus Purus in your own words. What is the relationship between the three terms?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Would most superheroes be best classified as natural or supernatural? They are clearly exceptional, but are they supernatural?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Are angels natural or supernatural? Do angels possess potency, actuality, or both?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Is everything that is supernatural Actus Purus?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				As Catholics, we believe that God is not exclusively supernatural. We believe that Jesus is the unity of the supernatural and the natural in one person. How does this knowledge inform the way in which we should approach the relationship between the natural and the supernatural as Catholics? Is one more important than the other?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Catholics are called to be separate from the world, yet we are material creatures. What are ways in which we can practically abandon materialism?
			</p>
		</li>

		Exercise 1:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Answers may vary (see the argument in the text to check for similarity to what you stated).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Actuality is the ability to bring forth potency. Potency is some change that can be realized in a thing. Actus Purus is a term for God that describes Him as pure actuality without potency. Actuality brings forth potency. The first actualization must have been from Actus Purus.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				They are exceptional but natural. They can be seen and touched. Their powers often work within nature (example: spiderman can only swing because of his webs).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Angels are supernatural (example: they don’t exist in one particular space; their movement defies the laws of physics). Angels can change and therefore possess potency. They can also influence other things and thus have actuality.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Angels are an example of something that is supernatural that nonetheless possesses potency. Only God is Actus Purus.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Human nature and human bodies are a part of God, through his Son, Jesus. God is therefore body and spirit, natural and supernatural. If we are to love God, we must love both parts. In caring for others, we must care for their bodily and spiritual needs.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				When we say we should abandon materialism, we mean that we should abandon unhealthy attachments. For instance, food is good, but gluttony is sinful. We can avoid gluttony by practicing occasional fasting.
			</p>
		</li>
