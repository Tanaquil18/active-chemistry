        A common argument against Catholicism and Christianity is that it is nothing but <term><xref ref="def-superstition" text="custom">superstition</xref></term>.  In doing so, they are trying to equate our faith with paganism and the myriad of other faiths that have existed throughout human history.  By doing so, they strive to show that all religions are the same and therefore equally invalid.  They'd argue that Christianity has no more merit than any other religion.  Furthermore, many atheists would go further by pointing out that things that previously seemed to mankind to be miraculous (example: the sun rising and setting) are now fully explainable by science.  Therefore, they say, we should turn to science instead of faith when seeking to control our fates.  This way of thinking is extremely common in our world today, but is it right?  I'd argue that it's wrong in every respect.

        The God of Christianity is <em>Actus purus</em> and is thus incapable of being controlled or acted upon by outside forces.  Often times, superstition seeks to exert control over supernatural forces.  This can take on many forms, some of which are more obvious than others.  Occult practices and divination are very obvious examples.  An athlete believing in a good luck charm or practice is another. Christians should acknowledge that it is impossible for us to change or affect God in any way.  Attempts to do so show a lack of respect for the dignity and sovereignty of God.

        Futhermore, the Christian God is different than many other gods in that he loves humanity and desires a relationship with each one of us.  Rather than seeking control over God, Christians should strive to seek friendship with Him.  Through prayer, we can then <em>ask</em> God to use His power in ways that will benefit us.  The choice to do so, however, still lies with God.  We can rest assured, however, that our God has compassion for each one of us and will always meet our needs, even if his care may manifest itself in unexpected ways.  Central to this are the words of Christ, who though God himself, does not seek to control the Father:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "...not my will but yours be done" <term>Luke 22:42</term>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Modern atheists often make the mistake of putting too much trust in scientific discoveries and technology, and Christians can easily fall into this trap as well.  When we do so, we're engaging in a form of idolatry.  Christians have been given dominion over the Earth:
   <blockquote>
    <p>
        "God blessed them and God said to them: Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it.* Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and all the living things that crawl on the earth." <term>Genesis 1:28</term>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
        It's therefore not wrong for us to seek control over nature.  However, we must always do in a way that respects the sovereignty of God.

                    Answers may vary but should include discussion of the sovreignty (and thus uncontrollability) of the Christian God.  It should also discuss that our God is a loving God who desires relationship with us and who has compassionate care for us.

                    Are there forms of superstition in your life?  To what extent do you think that you're actually trying to control God vs. just doing something fun.

                    If a person engages in a superstitious practice like not washing a shirt during a sports season, but doesn't actually believe that it's bringing them good luck, is there still harm being committed?

                    This can still be a form of scandal.  Others might be influenced to take up similar practices that they might actually believe in.  It can also create an appearance that engaging in superstition is okay or even beneficial for Catholics.
