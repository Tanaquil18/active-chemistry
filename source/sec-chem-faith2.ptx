		<term>The Greatest Commandment:</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In scripture, Jesus gives us the Greatest Commandment:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<em>“[Jesus] said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.</em> <em>This is the greatest and the first commandment.</em> <em>The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”</em> <term>Matthew 22:37-39</term>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	

	<p>
		Each of us lives and acts in the natural world. God gives us his commandments to help us live according to His will. The greatest commandment unites the supernatural and natural world into one rule for us. We should love God, and when we love one another, we are loving God by loving them. Humans are body (natural) and soul (supernatural). If we are to love our neighbor in a <term><xref ref="def-holistic" text="custom">holistic</xref></term> way, we must show concern for their natural and supernatural needs. This is reflected in in the following passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<em>“All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and love.  Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.”</em><term> Catechism of the Catholic Church 1878</term>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	

	<p>
		How do we care for the material needs of others? In many cases this is obvious. All people need food, water, and shelter. Providing access to quality healthcare is another way in which we love our neighbor through natural means. As Catholics, we should strive to ensure that our care for neighbor is not solely a material benefit, but a spiritual one as well. By incorporating empathy, compassion, friendship, and brotherly/sisterly love into our material service to one another, we ensure that we are holistically loving our neighbor and serving their needs in the best possible way. The Catholic Church clearly shows us ways that we can care for the body and soul of our neighbor through the lists of corporal (bodily) and spiritual works of mercy.

	<p>
		There are other less obvious ways in which we are also called to love our neighbor. Human beings are part of creation and exist within the environment around them. We must therefore show love to neighbor by ALSO showing respect for Creation. This is emphasized in the following quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as well as a couple of Papal encyclicals:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<em>“The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity.  Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.”</em> <term>Catechism of the Catholic Church 2415</term>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<em>“The environment is God's gift to everyone, and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards the poor, towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole… In nature, the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God's creative activity, which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs, material or otherwise, while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation.”</em><term> Caritas in Veritate 48.</term>	
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<em>“The created things of this world are not free of ownership: ‘For they are yours, O Lord, who love the living’ (Wis 11:26). This is the basis of our conviction that, as part of the universe, called into being by one Father, all of us are linked by unseen bonds and together form a kind of universal family, a sublime communion which fills us with a sacred, affectionate and humble respect.”</em><term> Laudato si 89.</term>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<em>“Moreover, when our hearts are authentically open to universal communion, this sense of fraternity excludes nothing and no one. It follows that our indifference or cruelty towards fellow creatures of this world sooner or later affects the treatment we mete out to other human beings. We have only one heart, and the same wretchedness which leads us to mistreat an animal will not be long in showing itself in our relationships with other people. Every act of cruelty towards any creature is ‘contrary to human dignity’. We can hardly consider ourselves to be fully loving if we disregard any aspect of reality: ‘Peace, justice and the preservation of creation are three absolutely interconnected themes, which cannot be separated and treated individually without once again falling into reductionism’”</em><term> Laudato si 92</term>
