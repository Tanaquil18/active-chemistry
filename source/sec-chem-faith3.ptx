	<p>
		<term>Science</term><fn>	<p>
		Science is a method for systematically studying the observable world.
	</p></fn> is a methodology that allows us to learn about nature. People have been doing science since the beginning of mankind. The development of tools, hunting methods, agriculture, etc. were all dependent on knowledge gained through science. The methodology used for science wasn’t rigorously defined until 1620 when Francis Bacon published his work <em>Novum Organum.</em> Further refinements and definitions have led to what we now call the <term>scientific method</term><fn>	<p>
		A process that allows us to develop explanations for the observations about the natural world. The core steps are observe, hypothesize, and experiment.
	</p></fn>. This process begins with making observations about the natural world. These observations can lead to laws or hypotheses. <term>Laws</term><fn>	<p>
		Laws are statements that express a repeated pattern of behavior in nature. Laws do NOT seek to explain the cause of the behavior.
	</p></fn> are statements about patterns invariably observed in nature (you can basically think of them as an observation with elite status). They are rules that seek to explain what will happen in a given circumstance based on what has been observed again and again, without exception. A common example of a law is the law of gravity. It can be described in different ways: “what goes up must come down”, “objects with mass attract one another”, or even with a mathematical equation (<m>F = G \times \frac{m_{a} \times m_{b}}{r^{2}}</m>). Note that these descriptions predict what will happen and may even provide a quantitative prediction, but they do NOT explain why. Laws do NOT have to be formalized in textbooks, though. For instance, I’d like to point out that most of us are familiar with the “law of glowing red metal” that states that glowing red metal is quite hot and probably shouldn’t be touched.
	</p>

	<p>
		The scientific method starts with an observation or law, but progresses further by seeking to explain why nature behaves in the way it does. A statement that seeks to explain the causes of natural phenomena that is based on observations or laws is called a <term>hypothesis</term><fn>	<p>
		A statement that seeks to explain observations of nature.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> A hypothesis is an explanation that has not been suitably tested. In order to lend support to a hypothesis, scientists often carry out experiments. A properly designed experiment tests the effect of a limited number of <term>variables</term><fn>	<p>
		The parameter or condition that is changed within an experiment.
	</p></fn> (ie. something that is changed, and therefore tested in an experiment) while striving to keep everything else as identical as possible. In a properly designed experiment, there are always a minimum of two possible groups: controls and experimental groups. The <term>control groups</term><fn>	<p>
		The groups within an experiment where the variable is unchanged. Positive controls attempt to cause the behavior to ensure that it can be observed. Negative controls often withhold the variable to allow for observation of what the behavior is in the absence of the variable.
	</p></fn> serve as comparisons, showing what the outcome is if the variable is ignored/absent/unchanged. The <term>experimental group</term><fn>	<p>
		Experimental groups include the variable and often involve changing it in some way (ex. amount of the variable, exposure time to the variable, etc.)
	</p></fn> consists of groups where the variable is changed. By comparing the results between the controls and experimental groups, we can reach conclusions about whether the experiment supports or refutes our hypothesis. Importantly, experiments can NEVER prove a hypothesis to be correct, instead they allow us to reject alternative explanations.
	</p>

	<p>
		When interpreting the results of experiments and trying to develop explanations for the causes of an observation, one of the principles that guides all of science is known as Ockham’s razor, which states that the simplest explanation that is consistent with known experimental results is the one that should be held. <term>William of Ockham,</term> the namesake of Ockham’s razor, was a Catholic Franciscan friar in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, and made several contributions to philosophy and theology. This further highlights the relationship between science, philosophy, and theology; the very roots of scientific thought and logic are grounded in philosophical and theological principles.
	</p>

	<p>
		Using Ockham’s razor, scientists can begin to piece together models that explain their observations. These models can lead to further hypotheses and experiments. If a hypothesis has withstood numerous experiments, it can be considered to be a <term>theory</term><fn>	<p>
		A hypothesis that has substantial experimental support. Theories can never be proven. They can be supported to greater and greater degrees, but they can never reach absolute certainty.
	</p></fn>. A theory is a hypothesis that has been repeatedly tested (a single experiment or test is rarely enough) and has NEVER been shown to be inconsistent with an experimental result. Experimental results that conflict with a hypothesis do NOT have to lead to outright rejection of the hypothesis and often instead lead to revision or addition of clarifications or exceptions. The distinction between a hypothesis and a theory is subjective and open to interpretation, but scientists all agree that enough experiments should have been carried out to allow obvious alternate explanations to be rejected.
	</p>

	<p>
		An example of the scientific method in action:
	</p>

	<p>
		A carpenter observes that wood is a strong building material that is capable of holding a large amount of weight and wants to understand why. The carpenter hypothesizes that thick wood is capable of holding more weight than thin wood. To test this, the carpenter sets up a control group consisting of wood with a standard thickness and experimental groups that have wood with other thicknesses (either thicker or thinner). He then tests each group by observing how many books each piece of wood can hold before breaking. His results show that thin boards hold less weight than thick boards. We’d say that board thickness <term>correlates</term><fn>	<p>
		Correlation is when we observe a pattern or relationship between changing a variable and the observed response. For instance, if increasing the amount of an antibiotic leads to greater observation of bacterial cell death, we’d say that the antibiotic amount correlates with bacterial cell death.
	</p></fn> with board strength. While this result supports his hypothesis, there are still other possible explanations for the result. For instance, perhaps the process used for reducing the thickness of the boards damaged the wood by introducing cracks. Alternatively, the thin pieces of wood might have had more (or fewer) wood grains and that might instead have been the source of the observed outcomes. . Correlation does not equal causation!

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Come up with 3 additional laws of nature that you have encountered in your own life that you won’t find listed in a science textbook.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Come up with 3 ways in which you used the scientific method in your own life without realizing what you were doing.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Look around you right now. Observe something and write it down. Try to develop a hypothesis that explains that observation. Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. Why controls would you need? What results would you expect that would validate your hypothesis?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Why is it important to develop alternative explanations to experimental observations?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				It is seen that lead exposure levels correlate with crime rates. Does this mean that lead exposure causes crime? If not, what come up with some alternative explanations.

				Light is coming through various sized slits in the blinds in my room. I think that light can always pass through any gap, no matter how small. I get two objects that can move to change the gap size between them. I place a light behind them and observe if the light can pass through at various gap sizes. A negative control would be if the objects were pressed together so no gap exists. A positive control would be the light itself without the objects to create the gap (to just make sure that I can see the light and that it’s working.

				These can remind us that scientific theories are never certain. Also, they can help us design new experiments to add greater certainty to theories (or possibly to prove them wrong).

				Not necessarily. Perhaps people who are exposed to higher levels of lead tend to be more impoverished. Perhaps that poverty is the root cause of the high crime rate.
