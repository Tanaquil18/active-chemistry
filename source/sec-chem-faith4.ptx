	</p>

		The modern world is obsessed with science. It is easy to think of science as a modern marvel, and indeed some people have begun to <term><xref ref="def-deify" text="custom">deify</xref></term> it. The discoveries of scientists have in many cases dramatically improved life for people around the world and promise to work wonders such as the eradication of disease (even if some of these promises seem far off). Many of the observations of nature that in history appeared miraculous now have scientific explanations and theories. For instance, the variety of life of Earth is now widely believed (even amongst Catholic scientists) to have resulted from evolution rather than a single creation event (it’s worth noting, less you think of this as a source of conflict between faith and science that Catholic scientists still believe in a Creation event, but that the events that followed and their timing differ from a literal reading of Genesis). Because of this, many people have come to reject religion as superstitious nonsense, since science appears (to some) as if it might be able to explain all natural phenomena. Many modern atheists use statements like this to argue that if God is not necessary to explain anything in nature, then it doesn’t make sense to believe in the existence of God. They of course forget that science is a tool for investigating only what can be <em>observed in nature</em>, and therefore it’s incapable of investigating the existence God. Furthermore, as we learned about in the previous lesson, supernatural causes are a logical necessity for the existence of nature. Additionally, the scientific method depends on <em>change</em> for experiments to work (recall that changes are actualization of some potency). All changes must ultimately have their root in Actus Purus…something that modern atheists conveniently ignore.

		On the other extreme, many people are prone to reject scientific progress for a variety of reasons. Indeed, scientific investigations and technological “advances” have created numerous problems for society, and it is understandable why people have developed a distrust of science as a result. In the 1920s, a scientist named Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered that the addition of a chemical compound containing lead into gasoline could help it burn in a more reliable way in car engines. Leaded gasoline was thus introduced and was used in the United States until 1996. Over that time, vast quantities of lead were released into the environment and resulted in a variety of toxic effect. In a different example, in the Tuskegee syphilis study, several hundred black men with syphilis in the United States had treatment unknowingly withheld from them so that scientists could study the long-term effects of the disease. Once the details of this horrendous study came to light, it understandably had a negative impact on the trust of black Americans for the American medical community<fn>	<p>

		Nowadays, there are many prominent examples of mistrust between the scientific community and various groups of people. Global warming and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are two prominent areas. In this text, I’ll neither argue for or against those issues, but instead focus on the root cause of the distrust. Some of the distrust stems from the fact that different scientific studies can sometimes arrive at different conclusions. The reasons for this are complex and varied, but so are the subjects being studied.
	</p>

	<p>
		For instance, one study might show that chemical X causes cancer while another study doesn’t. This disagreement might be due to differences in the amounts of chemical X used in the study, the amount of time of the exposure, the use of mice vs. rabbits, the type of test used, etc. Cancer is a very complex disease, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the studies and factors that influence its occurrence are complex as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		Similarly, in the field of climatology (the study of climate) there are studies and data that show evidence of man’s role in global warming and other data that disputes this. Can science come to meaningful conclusions then? In cases where different studies have different outcomes and conclusions, the scientific community tries to carry out more and better designed studies in an effort to arrive at a <term><xref ref="def-consensus" text="custom">consensus</xref></term>, but a consensus represents the belief that the majority of the best studies support a particular theory.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <term><xref ref="def-bias" text="custom">bias</xref></term> of researchers can also play a role in science. An ethical scientist tries to avoid bias, but it can be difficult to eliminate entirely, especially since the importance of a scientific discovery is often linked to funding. In some cases, bias can and has led to incorrect interpretations of data, outright falsification of data, and entirely incorrect conclusions. However, bias is present in pretty much every part of life, with examples ranging from restaurant preferences to political decision making. Bias shouldn’t be a reason to distrust all scientists and scientific theories, but it is important to scrutinize scientific conclusions, especially when they begin to impact our lives, the lives of others, and/or our environment.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another reason for distrust of science has to deal with a misunderstanding of what science is. I would argue that much of the disagreement and distrust of science in our society is not at science at all, but rather at <term><xref ref="def-engineering" text="custom">engineering</xref></term> and even more so <term><xref ref="def-politics" text="custom">politics</xref></term>. Engineering and science are closely related and interdependent fields. Where science seeks answers to the causes of things, engineering seeks to use that knowledge to create solutions to problems. Politics is related to both fields since our political leaders strive (or should strive) to find the best ways to use scientific knowledge and engineering creations to further the good of society.
	</p>

	<p>
		As an example, let’s take the example of the Covid vaccines. A combination of scientific discoveries and engineering advancements lead to the development of the first Covid vaccines. Their purpose was to combat the Covid-19 virus, which was rapidly spreading across the globe. The disease was poorly understood and was able to cause death, hence the desire for rapid vaccine development (a political decision). The development of the vaccine was extremely rapid, thanks to many advances in biochemical engineering and science. Political pressure led to the implementation of the vaccine before thorough testing by scientists and engineers had been accomplished. Vaccine mandates followed, and whether justified or not, they were undoubtedly controversial. Again, though, vaccine mandates are not science, they are political actions. Many people have argued that the vaccines were untested, ineffective, and potentially harmful and that science failed in these regards. I would argue that scientists and engineers did not fail at all, but actually performed extraordinarily well. The scientific method takes considerable time and in the case of the Covid vaccine, due to political decisions, much of the discoveries of scientists lagged behind the roll out of the vaccines and their mandatory implementation. Indeed, scientists can’t test the effectiveness and safety of something that hasn’t been created yet. The decision to roll out the vaccines before the typical years worth of testing were complete wasn’t a decision of scientists but one of politicians. Many scientists definitely contributed to those political decisions, but it’s important to realize that they weren’t acting as scientists but as <term><xref ref="def-activists" text="custom">activists</xref></term> in those instances. Activists can act in ethical or unethical ways, and the same goes for scientists (and I’ll leave it to the reader to form their own opinions in this case). I’d even argue that activism is a necessity among scientists; if scientists can’t advocate for the importance of their research, then it won’t get the funding or support that is needed to carry it out (in many ways this is like a small business owner advertising a new product…but I digress…). Now, years after the vaccine rollout, biologists have largely reached a consensus about the effectiveness and safety of the Covid-19 vaccines. The majority of scientific research supports the conclusion that the initial vaccines weren’t very effective at preventing the spread of the disease, though they were effective in lessening its severity. Additionally, statistical analysis revealed that there are a variety of safety issues that correlated with the initial vaccines, though their rate of occurrence was quite low. The scientific method didn’t fail us, but it took time to carry out the studies and arrive at conclusions. Unfortunately, and perhaps unavoidably, the lines between science, engineering, and politics are often blurred and this can regrettably result in distrust in science and scientists for reasons that aren’t science at all.

		When science and technology are deified, great error can result. On the other hand, lack of trust in scientists and their conclusions can lead to distrust and animosity and can potentially lead to the rejection of engineering advances that can help mankind. What then is the proper attitude to take towards science and its relationship to faith and human flouring? Read the following text from the Church’s Pastoral Constitution, <em>Gaudium et Spes</em>:
	</p>

	<p>
		“Christians, on pilgrimage toward the heavenly city, should seek and think of these things which are above. This duty in no way decreases, rather it increases, the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the building of a more human world. Indeed, the mystery of the Christian faith furnishes them with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this duty more courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity, one which gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man.
	</p>

	<p>
		When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of technology, in order that it might bear fruit and become a dwelling worthy of the whole human family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social groups, he carries out the design of God manifested at the beginning of time, that he should subdue the earth, perfect creation and develop himself. At the same time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself at the service of his brethren.
	</p>

	<p>
		Furthermore, when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy, history and of mathematical and natural science, and when he cultivates the arts, he can do very much to elevate the human family to a more sublime understanding of truth, goodness, and beauty, and to the formation of considered opinions which have universal value. Thus mankind may be more clearly enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which was with God from all eternity, composing all things with him, rejoicing in the earth, delighting in the sons of men.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this way, the human spirit, being less subjected to material things, can be more easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator. Moreover, by the impulse of grace, he is disposed to acknowledge the Word of God, Who before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was already "in the world" as "the true light which enlightens every man" (John 1:9-10).
	</p>

	<p>
		Indeed today's progress in science and technology can foster a certain exclusive emphasis on observable data, and an agnosticism about everything else. For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth. By virtue of their methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things. Indeed the danger is present that man, confiding too much in the discoveries of today, may think that he is sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher things.
	</p>

	<p>
		Those unfortunate results, however, do not necessarily follow from the culture of today, nor should they lead us into the temptation of not acknowledging its positive values. Among these values are included: scientific study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries, the necessity of working together with others in technical groups, a sense of international solidarity, a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even to protect men, the desire to make the conditions of life more favorable for all, especially for those who are poor in culture or who are deprived of the opportunity to exercise responsibility. All of these provide some preparation for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which can be animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world.”
	</p>

	<p>
		Pure science is a tool that humanity can use to gain knowledge of God’s creation. Knowledge of creation sheds light on its Creator and is therefore a commendable exercise for a Christian to undertake. Unfortunately, human history is filled with examples of the knowledge of science being misused for sinful purposes. The use of knowledge is distinct from the knowledge itself, often involving other human enterprises such as medicine, business, politics, etc. Science itself is not free from sin either. When scientists place the pursuit of knowledge above the laws of God, unethical experimentation can result.
