	</p>

	<p>
		All metals can form ions to form ionic compounds. However, for many metals (such as the transition metals) it is unrealistic to expect them to lose enough electrons to achieve the same electron configuration as a noble gas. Instead, these metals will lose fewer electrons in an effort to empty out their outer s or p orbitals, or to obtain other stable electron configurations. Often there are multiple ways for these metals to achieve stable states, and therefore these metals can adopt different charge states. For instance, iron has the electron configuration <m>\lbrack Ar\rbrack 4s^{2}3d^{6}</m>. Iron can empty out its 4s shell, losing 2 electrons in the process, and forming a Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion. Alternatively, iron can empty its 4s shell AND lose an electron from its 3d shell. This results in a semi-stable half-filled 3d shell. In this case, iron has lost 3 electrons, forming a Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion in the process.
	</p>

	<p>
		So which metals have variable charges and which ones don’t? The metals with known charges are listed below:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Metals in group 1 (+1 charge)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Metals in group 2 (+2 charge)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				C.A.Z.A.G. metals
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Cd, cadmium (+2 charge)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Al, aluminum (+3 charge)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Zn, zinc (+2 charge)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Ag, silver (+1 charge)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Ga, gallium (+3 charge)
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		All other metals in the periodic table have more than one possible charge.
	</p>

	<p>
		How are we supposed to know what the charge of a metal is in an ionic compound if it has a metal with variable charges. When naming these types of ionic compounds, we specify the charge of the metal by putting the charge in parentheses as a Roman numeral (see the table below). Importantly, we ONLY do this if the metal in the ionic compound has variable charges. So the name iron (III) chloride is an ionic compound between Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>; the (III) specifies that the charge on the iron is 3+. Chloride is in group 17, and thus we can determine that its charge is -1 (because it only needs one extra electron to have a noble gas electron configuration). From this information, we can determine that the formula for iron (III) chloride must be <m>FeCl_{3}</m> because 3 chloride ions would be needed to balance out the charge of the iron.

		Likewise, we can figure out the name of an ionic compound that involves a metal with variable charges by figuring out the charge on the metal by looking at the known charge on the anion. For example, if you were tasked with naming the compound <m>SnO_{2}</m>, you’d first need to recognize that tin is a metal with variable charges. In order to figure out its charge, we need to determine that oxide ions have a charge of -2. Since there are two oxides in the chemical formula, the total negative charge is 2(-2) = -4. The one Sn ion must have a positive charge that balances the negative charges from the oxides. Therefore the cation is Sn<sup>4+</sup>. To name the compound, we name the cation along with the charge in parentheses and then we name the anion. So the name of this compound is tin (IV) oxide.

		<term>Section 2: Polyatomic ions</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		There are ions (both cations and anions) that consist of more than one atom, and these are called <term>polyatomic</term> <term>ions</term>. These atoms are joined together by sharing electrons (covalent bonds) to form a single unit. This collective unit of atoms contains fewer electrons (if it’s a cation) or extra electrons (if it’s an anion), and thus the entire unit has a charge. We’ll explore the structures of these polyatomic ions later in this chapter. For now, we won’t worry about their structure. Rather we’ll focus on their component atoms and charges alone.
	</p>

	<p>
		Polyatomic ions have names, formulas, and charges that must be memorized. There are some patterns to their naming that become apparent after close inspection, and these patterns will be looked at as a part of the exercises below. The polyatomic ions that you are responsible for knowing are listed in the table below:

	<p>
		We can name ionic compounds that include polyatomic ions by following the same rules that we learned previously: we simply name the cation (with the charge, if needed) and then the anion. So if you have to name <m>NaNO_{3}</m>, you first of all, need to recognize that it’s an ionic compound (because it has a metal and nonmetals). Then you need to remember that sodium has a known charge (because it’s in group 1) and thus we won’t specify its charge in the name. Lastly, you need to recognize that <m>NO_{3}^{-}</m> is included in the formula and is called nitrate. Therefore, this compound is called sodium nitrate.
	</p>

	<p>
		One additional complication that arises when discussing polyatomic ions is that there is one polyatomic ion, ammonium, that is a cation. Thus, we can have ionic compounds that don’t have metals. They will instead have ammonium (<m>NH_{4}^{+}</m>) as a part of their formula. So <m>NH_{4}Cl</m> is an ionic compound that consists of an ammonium cation and a chloride anion. It is therefore named ammonium chloride.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sometimes chemical formulas will require that we include more than one polyatomic ion in order to balance the positive and negative charges. To specify this, the polyatomic ion is put inside of parentheses and a subscript number is written after the parentheses to indicate the number of polyatomic ions present. So if we were making a compound between <m>Cu^{2 +}</m> and <m>NO_{3}^{-}</m>, we’d need two nitrate ions to balance the charge, and the chemical formula would thus be written as <m>Cu\left( NO_{3} \right)_{2}</m>.
