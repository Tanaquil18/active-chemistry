		<term>Section 1: Lewis structures: Formal charge</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In many cases, a covalent compound will have atoms that are charged. Sometimes, multiple atoms in the structure will be charged, other times just a single atom. Sometimes the charges will cancel out (for instance if a structure has one atom with a +1 charge and another with a -1 charge), but in other cases they won’t (and we have a polyatomic ion). How then are we to figure out whether or not an atom in a structure is charged or not?
	</p>

	<p>
		To figure out the formal charge on an atom in a Lewis structure, we apply the rules listed below:
	</p>

	<p>
		Rules for formal charges:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				If the atom is making its typical number of bonds, it DOES NOT have a formal charge
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Atoms want to be surrounded by an octet (or duet) of electrons, but they don’t <em>own</em> all of them
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Atoms own all of their lone pair electrons
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Atoms own half of the electrons in the bonds connected to them
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Atoms want to own their number of valence electrons
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Charge=number of valence electrons desired-number of electrons owned in the structure
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		We can get clues from looking at a structure about what atom(s) are likely to have formal charges. Recall from an earlier exercise, how we can figure out the typical number of bonds that an atom will make (example: oxygen has 6 valence electrons so it needs 2 bonds to get to its octet). When an atom makes its typical number of bonds in a structure, that atom will typically have a charge of zero. If the atom is making a different number of bonds, then it is more likely to have a formal charge. You can use this to help you quickly narrow down which atoms are likely to have a charge in a structure. For example, oxygen atoms with 2 bonds almost always have a formal charge of zero. Oxygen atoms with one bond and 3 bonds are typically negatively and positively charged, respectively. (see the figure below)
	</p>

	<p>
		Now that we know how to compute the formal charge on atoms in a Lewis structure, we should update our rules for Lewis structures with one additional step:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
			<p>
		Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons!
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2<sup>nd</sup> bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Figure out the formal charge on the atoms (if any). List the formal charge next to the atom and circle it for emphasis
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

		<term>Section 2: Lewis structures: Exceptions to the octet rule</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Some atoms are capable of having more than an octet of electrons around them. Atoms in the 3<sup>rd</sup> period of the periodic table and beyond are large enough that they can accommodate more electrons in their outer shell. In addition, they are not limited to just s and p orbitals; they also have d-orbitals which allow them to hold more than 8 electrons. To account for this, we have to add to some of our rules (highlighted in red) and also add an extra rule at the end.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
			<p>
		Basic rules for Lewis structures of molecules:
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Draw the skeleton structure. Arrange the atoms with atoms that can make more bonds (ex. C, N, O) in the center and atoms that can make fewer bonds on the outside (ex. H and halogens). Remember that atoms in the 3<sup>rd</sup> period and below may be capable of making more than their typical number of bonds.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Count the total number of valence electrons. Add electrons for negative charges; subtract electrons for positive charges. Your final structure must have this number of electrons in it!!!
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Form single bonds between the center atom and peripheral atoms. Remember that each bond is 2 electrons. Count how many electrons you have remaining
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Place the remaining electrons around the outer atoms first and then the inner atoms until you have an octet (or duet) of electrons around each atom. Don’t forget that the bonds have 2 electrons! If you have extra electrons after giving every atom an octet, go ahead and place the additional electrons around an atom that’s from the 3<sup>rd</sup> period or lower (usually the central atom in your structure).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				If any of the atoms don’t have an octet, then move a lone pair from an adjacent atom to make a 2<sup>nd</sup> bond between the atoms. This effectively adds to electrons to the receiving atom while keeping the electrons with the donor atom. Repeat this step as needed. You can form triple bonds, but you will never form a quadruple bond!

			<p>
				Figure out the formal charge on the atoms (if any). List the formal charge next to the atom and circle it for emphasis
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				If the central atom is in the 3<sup>rd</sup> period or lower, we have to check to see if it should make additional bonds and thereby break the octet rule. Try moving a lone pair from an outer atom and forming an additional bond to the center atom. Re-evaluate the formal charges. Repeat step 7 as needed. You are trying to…

			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Eliminate atoms with multiple charges (ie. +2 or -2)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Minimize the number of atoms with a charge
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Prevent adjacent like-charges (ie. No negative charges on adjacent atoms…adjacent positive and negative charges can be okay)
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Note: Usually the central atom will end up with a charge of 0

	</p>

	<p>
		In this section, we’re not going to be adding any new knowledge. Instead, we’ll be tying your new skills to material that you’ve learned previously. Polyatomic ions are ions that consist of multiple atoms that are bound together through covalent bonds. In this section you’ll be determining the structure of polyatomic ions that we’ve previously covered and you’ll be determining which atom(s) in the structure contain the formal charges.
