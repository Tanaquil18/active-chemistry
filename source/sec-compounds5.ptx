		<term>Naming diatomic covalent compounds</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The rules for naming covalent compounds are actually much more complex than those of ionic compounds and will be covered in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of this book once we get to organic chemistry. For now, we’ll limit our focus to binary (only two atom types) covalent compounds. We name binary diatomic compounds in a similar way that we name diatomic ionic compounds. We are going to name the first atom and then the second atom with its ending swapped for -ide. However, we also add on a prefix to both the first and second word that indicates how many atoms there are (with one exception). We have to do this because the atoms aren’t charged and thus we can’t figure out how many are present from the name alone. So what are these prefixes and what’s the exception? The prefixes are listed in the table below. The exception to adding prefixes is that we don’t add “mono-“ to the first word if there is only one.

		<term>Geometry</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In chemistry, the shape of a molecule can be incredibly important. The shape of a pharmaceutical molecule allows it to properly interact with its biological target. The shape of a protein controls its function inside of a cell, allowing for things like metabolism and movement to occur. In order to understand the shape of complex molecules, we must first understand the shape/geometry around a single atom within a covalent compound. Two or more <term>electron groups</term> are found around the atom whose geometry we’re considering. An electron group is defined as either a lone pair of electrons or an atom (or group of atoms) that is bound directly to the atom that we’re considering. If we know the number of electron groups, then we can determine the <term>electron geometry</term> using VSEPR theory. This theory states that the electron groups will spread out in 3D space as much as possible in order to maximize the distance between them. The electron geometries that we observe in molecules are dependent on the number of electron groups. If we have two electron groups around a central atom, then the best way for nature to separate them is to have them on completely opposite sides of the central atom. This creates a linear arrangement of our two electron groups and the central atom, and thus this electron geometry is called “linear” and has a bond angle of 180 degrees. If three electron groups are present, then they spread out in a flat triangular arrangement and the geometry is called “trigonal planar” and has bond angles of 120 degrees. With four electron groups, they must spread out in a 3D arrangement called “tetrahedral” with bond angles of 109.5 degrees (see the table below).
	</p>

	<p>
		The electron geometry is useful information, but often we don’t care about where the lone pairs of electrons are and want to focus solely on the shape of the atoms in a molecule. When we’re figuring this out, we’re determining the <term>molecular geometry (or molecular shape).</term> The molecular geometries are determined by first figuring out the electron geometry. Once we’ve done this, we can ignore/”cover-up” the electron groups that are lone-pairs of electrons, allowing us to focus on the ones that are groups of atoms. It’s important to note that the lone pairs of electrons are still present and still taking up space, but we’re simply choosing to ignore them. Thus if we have 3 electron groups around a central atom, but one of them is a lone pair of electrons, then the electron geometry is trigonal planar. If we cover up one of the electron groups, the resulting molecular geometry is called “bent” and it still has a bond angle of 120 degrees…the same as its electron geometry. If we have 4 electron groups, the electron geometry is tetrahedral and we have bond angles of 109.5 degrees. If one of the groups is a lone pair of electrons, then the molecular geometry has a non-flat triagonal molecular geometry called “trigonal pyramidal”. If two of the electron groups are lone pairs

		<term>Polarity and intermolecular forces</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When considering the types of bonding that are observed in chemistry, we use two distinct terms: ionic bonding and covalent bonding. In actuality, there are bonds that are somewhat in-between as well, where the electrons are being shared, but in a non-equal way. This results in one of the atoms having slightly more electrons than it should (producing a partial negative charge, depicted as <m>\delta^{-}</m>) and one having slightly fewer than it should (producing a partial positive charge, depicted as <m>\delta^{+}</m>). This type of bond is called a <term>polar covalent bond</term> because it has partial positive and negatively charged ends, or poles. A covalent bond where the electrons are shared equally is called a <term>nonpolar covalent bond</term>.
	</p>

	<p>
		How can we figure out if electrons will be shared equally between two atoms? To determine this, we need to look at the <term>electronegativity</term> value of each of the bonded atoms. Electronegativity is a measure of how much an atom will attract additional electrons towards itself. The highest electronegativity value is fluorine, which will attract electrons the strongest. The lowest values are seen at the bottom left of the periodic table. See the chart in the link: <url href="https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/E/electronegativity.html">Electronegativity chart</url> . To determine if a bond is polar, we subtract the electronegativity values of the two bound atoms. If the difference is &lt;0.5, then the electrons are shared more-or-less equally and the bond is non-polar. If the difference is 0.5-1.7 then the bond is a polar covalent bond, <em>with the atom with the greater electronegativity value having the partial negative charge</em>. If the difference is greater than 1.7, then the bond is likely an ionic bond.
	</p>

	<p>
		A <term>polar molecule</term> is one that has a partially positive side and a partial negative side. If a molecule has polar covalent bonds then the molecule itself is often (but not always polar). The exception to this is when the polar covalent bonds cancel out one another due to a symmetric geometry. If the molecular geometry is either linear, trigonal planar, or tetrahedral (ie. one of the molecular geometries that doesn’t have a lone pair) AND the bonds are equivalent, then the polarities of the bonds will cancel out, resulting a case where we have polar bonds but a non-polar molecule. So in order to determine if a molecule is polar, we have to:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Ask if it has polar bonds
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Make sure that the polar bonds don’t cancel each other out
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<term>How can polarity cancel out in a molecule?</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two requirements:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				The polar bonds must be equivalent in strength (generally they will be bonds between identical elements)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				The polar bonds must be symmetric
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Generally this means that the molecular shape must be tetrahedral, trigonal, planar, or linear
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						There cannot be lone pairs of electrons on the central atom
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		The polarity (or non-polarity) of a molecule determines how it is able to interact with other molecules. This is useful for understanding things like how DNA is held together, what gives proteins their shapes, how pharmaceuticals interact with proteins, etc. There are 4 types of intermolecular forces that we’re going to discuss: <term>ionic bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds,</term> and <term>London dispersion forces.</term> We’ve already learned about ionic bonds. This is the attraction between cations and anions that holds together ionic compounds. Basically any time we have a full positive or negative charge on an atom or a molecule, it will be able to interact with ionic bonds.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dipole-dipole interactions are like ionic bonds in that a positive charge attracts a negative charge, but the distinguishing feature is that the charges are partial charges in this case. Polar molecules have partial positive and partial negative ends and are thus able to form dipole-dipole interactions with one another. This is why a polar molecule like sugar is able to interact with another polar molecule like water, allowing water to dissolve sugar.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when we have a polar N-H, O-H, or H-F bond that is able to interact with a lone pair of electrons. The hydrogen atom in each of the listed bonds has a partial positive charge. However, since hydrogen only has one electron, having it be partially positively charged is basically exposing a bare nucleus, allowing it to form bonds that are much stronger than other dipole-dipole interactions. The partially positively charged hydrogen atom is attracted to the partial negative charge of a lone-pair of electrons, forming a special type of dipole-dipole interaction (because of the exposed hydrogen nucleus) that we call a hydrogen bond.
	</p>

	<p>
		London dispersion forces are the weakest of all of the intermolecular forces. They are a type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when temporary dipoles form. In every molecule the electrons are continually shifting. Sometimes this shifting/movement of electrons creates a partial charge imbalance in the molecule, resulting in a partial negative and partial positive charge. These partial charges can attract those of adjacent molecules. Since these forces are dependent on the normal movement of electrons in any molecule, ALL molecules can interact with London dispersion forces. These forces are the reason why non-polar molecules can still interact with one another and simply don’t fly apart. Gasoline, for instance, is very non-polar but the molecules interact with one another strongly enough to hold together in a liquid form at room temperature.
	</p>

	<p>
		In terms of strength, ionic bonds are the strongest due to the complete positive and negative charges. Hydrogen bonds are next, followed by dipole-dipole interactions. Last, in terms of strength, are London dispersion forces.
