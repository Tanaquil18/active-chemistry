		<term>Kinetic molecular theory of gases and pressure</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Gases are a state of matter. Gases are similar to liquids in that they adopt the shape of their containers, but are different in that they will spread out to occupy the entire volume of their container. Thus gases do NOT have a fixed volume or a fixed shape. To better understand these properties as well as other properties of gases that we’ll be learning abou in this chapter, scientists have developed the <term>kinetic molecular theory of gases.</term> This theory states that the properties of a gas can be understood by a model that assumes the following:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Gases consist of tiny particles that occupy only a small percentage of the total volume of the gas
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				The gas molecules are constantly moving with very high speeds
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Gas molecules do not interact with one another at all due to their high speeds and the fact that they occupy such a small percentage of the volume of the gas
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				When gas molecules impact one another or the sides of their container, they bounce off, essentially losing none of their energy.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				The average speed of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature. So as temperature increases, the gas molecules move more quickly.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		This information about gases will help us to understand other properties of gases as well as the gas laws that we’ll encounter later in the chapter. The first such property that we can begin to discuss is <term>pressure.</term> When a gas is near a surface (like air near our bodies) or trapped in a container, then the gas molecules will impact the surfaces that they’re exposed to with a certain amount of force. This force will push against that surface. When a force is being applied to a surface, we can measure the pressure being exerted. Pressure is simply the amount of force being applied divided by the area of the surface that it’s being applied to. This can be illustrated easily using everyday objects. If you place a large piece of wood on top of another piece of wood and hit it with a hammer, you’re unlikely to drive one piece of wood into the other. However if you place a nail on a piece of wood and hit it with a hammer, you can easily drive the nail into the wood. Why? The amount of force applied with the hammer was the exact same. However, in the first case, the amount of surface that the force was applied to was large, meaning that the pressure was small. In the case of the nail, that same amount of force is applied to the narrow point of a nail (a much smaller area) so the nail has a very high pressure and is able to easily penetrate the wood.
	</p>

	<p>
		The idea of gas pressure is actually quite fascinating when you think about it. We know that we can inflate balloons by filling them with a gas and that this gas exerts a certain amount of pressure (that we can easily feel if you try and squeeze the balloon). The bizarre thing about the balloon, though, is that the ballon is almost entirely empty. What keeps it inflated isn’t that it is ‘full of air’, it’s that the little bit of air inside is impacting the balloon surface with such force that it’s continually driving it outwards, keeping it inflated. In fact, each gas molecule inside of a helium balloon at room temperature is impacting the surface of the balloon with a speed of approximately 4000 miles per hour!!!
	</p>

	<p>
		We can measure the pressure of a gas using various units. The SI unit for pressure is a Pascal (Pa), and like other SI units we can attach metric prefixes to it. Other units of pressure are commonly used also. These include atmospheres (atm), bars, inches (or millimeters) of mercury, and pounds per square inch. If you ever need to convert between these various units on an exam, a conversion factor will be provided.

		<term>Basic gas laws</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The kinetic molecular theory of gases can give rise to our understanding of three basic gas laws: <term>Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and Gay-Lussac’s Law.</term> These laws relate changes in pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas. Each law also has an associated equation that can be used to determine the effect of changing the pressure, volume, or temperature of a gas.
	</p>

	<p>
		Boyle’s law states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional to one another if the temperature is kept constant. This means that as one goes up, the other must go down (ex. if the volume decreases then the pressure must increase). We can understand this quite easily if we reflect on the kinetic molecular theory of gases. If gas molecules are moving around with a certain speed, because the temperature is kept constant, and we shrink the container that the gas is trapped in, then the gas molecules will be impacting the walls of the container more frequently and thus the pressure exerted will increase. Most of us have probably experienced Boyle’s law if you’ve ever tried to squeeze a balloon. When you do that, you are attempting to reduce the volume of the gas, and as you do so, it gets harder and harder to squeeze. Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, this can be described mathematically as <m>P \times V = c</m> where c is a constant (the value of this constant isn’t important and actually varies depending on a number of factors). With that equation, if we increase pressure, then volume must decrease in order for the product to still equal c. This relationship hold true as long and the amount of gas and the temperature are kept constant…so under one set of conditions <m>P_{1} \times V_{1} = c</m> and under a second set of pressure and volumes <m>P_{2} \times V_{2} = c</m>. Since both of these equations equal c, we can set them equal to one another to get the equation for Boyle’s law:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>P_{1} \times V_{1} = P_{2} \times V_{2}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This equation can be used to determine the new pressure of a gas if the volume changes or to find the new volume if the pressure changes (again, assuming that the temperature and the amount of the gas are fixed).
	</p>

	<p>
		Charles’s law relates the volume and temperature of a gas, stating that these two properties are directly proportional (assuming that the pressure and amount of gas are constant). This again agrees with kinetic molecular theory because if I increase the temperature of a gas, the molecules will move faster, this would cause them to impact the sides of the container with more force, thus increasing the pressure. If the pressure is being held constant, however, the only way to allow for this is to have the volume of the gas increase, causing the impacts of the gas on the sides of the container to become less frequent. Thus an increase in temperature causes an increase in volume and a decrease in temperature would cause a decrease in volume. Many of us have also seen Charles’s law in our lives. Charles’s law is used to inflate hot air balloons; the heat from the flame at the base of the balloon heats the gas inside causing the volume of the balloon to increase and inflate. This relationship can be described mathematically by <m>\frac{V}{T} = c</m> where c is a constant. Like in Boyle’s law, this equation will hold under different conditions, so we can similarly derive the equation for Charle’s law:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}} = \frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>It is VERY important to note that this equation only works if the temperatures have units of Kelvin!!!!</em> Using this equation we can predict the new volume of a gas if the temperature changes or the new temperature if the volume changes (assuming that the amount of gas and the pressure are constant)
	</p>

	<p>
		The final law that we’ll cover in this section is Gay-Lussac’s Law. This law states that pressure and temperature are directly proportional if the volume and amount of gas are fixed. Gay-Lussac’s law can be understood if we realize that increasing the temperature causes the speed of molecules to increase. If the size of the container is kept the same, then those molecules will impact the sides with more force, thus increasing the pressure. Gay-Lussac’s law can be described with the formula:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}} = \frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This equation can be used to find the new pressure if the temperature of a gas changes or the new temperature if the pressure changes (again, assuming that the volume and amount of gas don’t change).
