		<term>Henry’s Law and Breathing</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Henry’s Law</term> is our last gas law. It deals with <term>solubility.</term> Solubility is the amount of a material that can be dissolved into another; in this case, we’re talking about how much gas can dissolve in water. Henry’s law states that the solubility of a gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure. If the partial pressure of a gas is increased, it can press its way into the liquid more easily, and thus more of that gas dissolves.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now we’re going to do some practice problems dealing with gas laws and breathing.

		<em>Exercise 1:</em>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>The lungs inflate and deflate because of the action of a muscle called the diaphragm. This muscle causes the lung volume to expand and contract.</em>
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>If the volume of the lungs increases, what happens to the air pressure inside of the lungs? Which law dictates this?</em>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>If the volume of the lungs decreases, what happens to the air pressure inside of the lungs?</em>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>Air will spontaneously move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. For a and b above, which corresponds to inhaling, and which corresponds to exhaling?</em>
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>In our lungs our cells are exposed to air that has a high partial pressure of oxygen gas. Would the solubility of oxygen in our blood in the lungs be high or low?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>When blood travels through our peripheral tissues, the amount of oxygen gas decreases because it gets taken up by our tissues. This __________(decreases/increases) the partial pressure of oxygen that the blood is exposed to and thus ___________(increases/decreases) the solubility of oxygen in the blood. Explain how this makes it easier for muscles to obtain oxygen from the bloodstream.</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Carbon dioxide is made in our peripheral tissues and is only a small component of our atmosphere. As a result the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is __________(high/low) in our peripheral tissues, meaning that its solubility in our blood is ______ (high/low). When blood travels to the lungs, due to the low amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, its partial pressure is ____(high/low). This _______(increases/decreases) the solubility of carbon dioxide in the blood, allowing it to be eliminated from the body.</em>

		<term>Which Equation do I Need??</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Each of the problems that you’ve done thus far is within a single section of the chapter, making it relatively easy to figure out what equation to use. On an exam, the problems are not organized in such a straightforward manner, and it falls on you to figure out which one(s) you need to use. Here are some tips:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the problem, is something about the gas changing (pressure, volume, moles, temperature)? If so, then you want to use an equation with the subscript 1’s and 2’s…Boyle’s, Charles’s, Gay-Lussac’s, Combined Gas Law, Avogadro’s Law.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Are you trying to find a missing parameter about the gas, but nothing is changing…probably need the Ideal Gas Law.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Is your problem dealing with a reaction or mass of the gas? If so, you probably need to change to moles (using either molar mass or the Ideal Gas Law)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Partial pressures or gas mixtures? Then think Dalton’s Law
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Find an equation that has the parameters that are provided and the one that you want. (if you are given a starting pressure and temperature of a gas, and the pressure is changed and you’re being asked for temperature, then Gay-Lussac’s should be used because it has only pressure and temperature in the equation)
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<em>Exercise 2:</em>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>If you have 2.0 grams of argon gas in a 25L balloon, what will the new volume be if 3.0 grams of argon gas is added. Assume that the temperature and pressure do NOT change.</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>If a gas has a pressure of 2.1 atm and a volume of 3.3 L, what will the new pressure be if the volume is expanded to 5.7 L?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>A gas at 271 K, 3.3 atm of pressure, and with a volume of 5.4 L is heated to 299K at the same time that its volume is decrease to 1.7 L. What is the new pressure?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>3.5 grams of gaseous water vapor is at a temperature of 452K in a volume of 150mL. What is the pressure of this gas in MPa?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>2.5 moles of gas A completely reacts to form gases B and C according to the reaction below. The reaction takes place in a 15L vessel at 522K.</em>
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>2A(g) \rightarrow B(g) + 3C(g)</me>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>What is the pressure in units of Pa at the beginning of the reaction in MPa?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>What is the partial pressure of B in the vessel at the end of the reaction in MPa?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>What is the total pressure in the vessel at the end of the reaction in MPa?</em>
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>

						<em>Pressure decreases, Boyle’s law</em>

				<li>
					<p>
						<em>Pressure increases, Boyle’s law</em>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>A is inhaling, B is exhaling</em>
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>High solubility of oxygen</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Decreases, decreases. Since the blood has a lower solubility of oxygen due to Henry’s Law, this causes even more oxygen to leave the blood for the tissues to use, ultimately removing almost all of the oxygen from the blood for use by tissues in the body.</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>High, high, low, decreases</em>
