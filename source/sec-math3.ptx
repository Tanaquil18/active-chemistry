		The final part of this math review is a brief review of algebra. We use algebra to rearrange mathematical expressions to solve for some unknown. There are two things to remember when doing algebraic rearrangements. First, our goal is to isolate the variable of interest, remembering that <em>it must be in the numerator</em> if we’re dealing with fractions. Second, the way in which we will isolate the variable is by carrying out opposite operations on both sides of the equation.  Some useful reminders:

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Addition and subtraction are opposite operations; multiplication and division are opposite operations
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<p>Example: <m>32=x-3</m> </p><p>To isolate x we must add three to both sides because addition is the opposite operation for subtraction</p><p><m>32=x-3 \rightarrow \\32+3=x-3+3 \rightarrow \\35=x</m></p>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<p>Example: <m>32=\frac{x}{2}</m> </p><p>To isolate x we must multiply both sides by 2 because multiplication is the opposite operation for division</p><p><m>32=\frac{x}{2} \rightarrow \\32\times 2=\frac{x}{2}\times 2 \rightarrow \\64=x</m></p>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				If there are multiple quantities that must be moved, work in the direction of the reverse of the order of operations
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<p>Example: <m>3x+5=14</m></p><p>We have to use two reverse operations (subtraction and division) to isolate x, but which do we do first?  If we were computing the left side of the equation, we'd first multiply 3 times x and then add 5.  When isolating x, we must go in the reverse order of operations.  So in this case we need to undo the addition of 5 before undoing the multiplication by 3.  So the first thing we do is subtract 5 from both sides. Then we can divide by 3.</p><p><m>3x+5=14 \rightarrow \newline 3x+5-5=14-5 \rightarrow \newline 3x=9 \rightarrow \newline 3x\div3=9\div3 \rightarrow \newline x=3</m></p>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<p>Example: <m>\frac{x+5}{2}=7</m></p><p>If we were computing the left side of the equation, we'd first add 5 to x and then divide the sum by 2.  The reverse order would have us first multiply both sides of the equation by two and then subtract 5 from both sides.</p><p><m>\frac{x+5}{2}=7 \rightarrow \\\frac{x+5}{2}\times2=7\times2 \rightarrow \\x+5=14 \rightarrow \\x+5-5=14-5 \rightarrow \\x=9</m></p>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				If the unknown is in the denominator of a fraction, you need to move it to the numerator.  You can do this by either multiplying both sides by the unknown or by taking the reciprocal (ie. flipping) of both sides of the equation.
