	<p>
		In chemistry, we use math a lot. The numbers that we use in our calculations often describe measurements or numbers of things, such as numbers of molecules. This then raises an important consideration for us, namely how precisely do we know the numbers in our calculations? For instance, if I’m measuring the length of a piece of string, do I know its length precisely to the nearest inch, or to the nearest millimeter, or to the nearest nanometer? The answer to that question depends on the tools that were used to make the measurement and their level of precision. Obviously, you won’t be able to tell how many nanometers long a piece of string is by using a typical ruler; another much more expensive measuring device would likely be required.
	</p>

	<p>
		To understand how precisely we know a quantity, we will first discuss the difference between <term><xref ref="def-exact" text="custom">exact</xref></term> and <term><xref ref="def-measured" text="custom">measured</xref></term> numbers. Exact numbers are discrete things that can be counted (ex. 3 eggs), quantities that are exact definitions (ex. there are 12 inches in one foot), or desired values (ex. the established dosage for a pharmaceutical is 10 mg/kg/day). Measured numbers are any quantity that had to be measured. They are also found when we are equating units that occur in different systems of measurement (ex. 2.54 cm=1 inch; 1 inch is very close to 2.54 cm, but an inch is not defined as being exactly 2.54 cm).
	</p>

	<p>
		Exact numbers are known to an infinite level of precision. If you have 3 eggs, you don’t have 3.0000001 eggs…you have exactly 3.00000000… (keeps on going…) eggs. If the dosage of drug that you are supposed to give to a patient is 10mg/kg/day, the desired dose is not higher or lower than that…it is exactly that value. Measured numbers, on the other hand, are known only to a certain level of precision. A race may have taken exactly 9.813453223 (feel free to add other random digits on the end) seconds, but if I am using a stop watch that only measures hundredths of a second, then my measured value would be 9.81 seconds. Because of this, measured numbers always have a certain amount of uncertainty associated with them. How then do we communicate the level of certainty with which we know a number?
	</p>

	<p>
		This brings us to the concept of <term><xref ref="def-significantfigures" text="custom">significant figures</xref></term>. Significant figures are those digits in a number that reveal the level of precision. We have to worry about the number of significant figures when we’re dealing with measured numbers, since those values are only known to a certain degree of precision. If a stopwatch at the end of a race reads 9.81 seconds, then that measurement has 3 significant figures (the 9, 8, and 1 are each significant). In that case, the time was measured to the hundredths place, but not to the thousandths place and the reported value should reflect that. Exact numbers, on the other hand, have an infinite number of significant figures because of their infinite precision.
	</p>

	<p>
		In a measured numbers, there are some simple rules to remember in order to identify which digits are significant. First of all, non-zero digits are always significant when the number is written in standard notation (more on scientific notation in just a little bit). The complication comes from zeros in measured numbers.

	<title>Rules for significant digits</title>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				All non-zero digits are significant.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Zeroes are sometimes significant
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						When zeros are to the far left of the number, they are never significant
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						Zeros in between non-zero digits are always significant
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						Zeros to the far right of a number are significant ONLY if there is a decimal point written in the number.
					</p>
				</li>

			<p>
		Some examples of this:
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				0.0034 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 1)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				3001 (the zeros are significant because of rule 2)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				400.0 (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				300 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				300. (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3; notice the decimal has been purposely included)
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		The last rule for significant figures has to deal with scientific notation. In scientific notation, the power and the base are NOT significant. The only significant figures come from the coefficient portion, and it obeys the rules covered previously, including the rules about zeros. So <m>4.0010 \times 10^{10}</m> has 5 significant figures (4.0010; the 10 to the 10<sup>th</sup> power is not significant). Sometimes we HAVE to write a number in scientific notation to convey the correct number of significant figures. For instance, if you measured as distance of 300 cm to 2 significant figures, you can’t indicate that by writing 300 cm (1 significant figure) or 300. cm (2 significant figures). You can show it by writing <m>3.0 \times 10^{2}</m>cm.
