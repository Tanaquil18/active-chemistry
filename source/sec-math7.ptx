		Success in chemistry is often heavily dependent on math skills. This can be intimidating to many students. I want to assure you that the required level of math is actually quite doable, but you need to practice it! In fact, much of the math that we regularly do in chemistry is quite similar to non-chemistry problems that you easily do without much thought. This section's exercise deals with some of these sorts of problems and gradually builds up the complexity.
