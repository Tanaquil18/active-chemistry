		<term>Section 1: Significant Figures</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In chemistry, we use math a lot. The numbers that we use in our calculations often describe measurements or numbers of things, such as numbers of molecules. This then raises an important consideration for us, namely how precisely do we know the numbers in our calculations? For instance, if I’m measuring the length of a piece of string, do I know its length precisely to the nearest inch, or to the nearest millimeter, or to the nearest nanometer? The answer to that question depends on the tools that were used to make the measurement and their level of precision. Obviously, you won’t be able to tell how many nanometers long a piece of string is by using a typical ruler; another much more expensive measuring device would likely be required.
	</p>

	<p>
		To understand how precisely we know a quantity, we will first discuss the difference between <term>exact</term><fn>	<p>
		An exact number is one that is countable, a definition, or a desired quantity. Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures.
	</p></fn> and <term>measured</term><fn>	<p>
		A measured number is a number that exists because of some measurement. Measured numbers have a finite number of significant figures.
	</p></fn> numbers. Exact numbers are discrete things that can be counted (ex. 3 eggs), quantities that are exact definitions (ex. there are 12 inches in one foot), or desired values (ex. the established dosage for a pharmaceutical is 10 mg/kg/day). Measured numbers are any quantity that had to be measured. They are also found when we are equating units that occur in different systems of measurement (ex. 2.54 cm=1 inch; 1 inch is very close to 2.54 cm, but an inch is not defined as being exactly 2.54 cm).
	</p>

	<p>
		Exact numbers are known to an infinite level of precision. If you have 3 eggs, you don’t have 3.0000001 eggs…you have exactly 3.00000000… (keeps on going…) eggs. If the dosage of drug that you are supposed to give to a patient is 10mg/kg/day, the desired dose is not higher or lower than that…it is exactly that value. Measured numbers, on the other hand, are known only to a certain level of precision. A race may have taken exactly 9.813453223 (feel free to add other random digits on the end) seconds, but if I am using a stop watch that only measures hundredths of a second, then my measured value would be 9.81 seconds. Because of this, measured numbers always have a certain amount of uncertainty associated with them. How then do we communicate the level of certainty with which we know a number?
	</p>

	<p>
		This brings us to the concept of <term>significant figures</term><fn>	<p>
		Significant figures are those digits in a number that convey information about its value and its precision.
	</p></fn>. Significant figures are those digits in a number that reveal the level of precision. We have to worry about the number of significant figures when we’re dealing with measured numbers, since those values are only known to a certain degree of precision. If a stopwatch at the end of a race reads 9.81 seconds, then that measurement has 3 significant figures (the 9, 8, and 1 are each significant). In that case, the time was measured to the hundredths place, but not to the thousandths place and the reported value should reflect that. Exact numbers, on the other hand, have an infinite number of significant figures because of their infinite precision.
	</p>

	<p>
		In a measured numbers, there are some simple rules to remember in order to identify which digits are significant. First of all, non-zero digits are always significant when the number is written in standard notation (more on scientific notation in just a little bit). The complication comes from zeros in measured numbers.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are three rules to remember with zeros:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				When zeros are to the far left of the number, they are never significant
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Zeros in between non-zero digits are always significant
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Zeros to the far right of a number are significant ONLY if there is a decimal point written in the number.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<blockquote>
			<p>
		Some examples of this:
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				0.0034 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 1)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				3001 (the zeros are significant because of rule 2)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				400.0 (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				300 (none of these zeros are significant because of rule 3)
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				300. (all of these zeros are significant because of rule 3; notice the decimal has been purposely included)
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		The last rule for significant figures has to deal with scientific notation. In scientific notation, the power and the base are NOT significant. The only significant figures come from the coefficient portion, and it obeys the rules covered previously, including the rules about zeros. So <m>4.0010 \times 10^{10}</m> has 5 significant figures (4.0010; the 10 to the 10<sup>th</sup> power is not significant). Sometimes we HAVE to write a number in scientific notation to convey the correct number of significant figures. For instance, if you measured as distance of 300 cm to 2 significant figures, you can’t indicate that by writing 300 cm (1 significant figure) or 300. cm (2 significant figures). You can show it by writing <m>3.0 \times 10^{2}</m>cm.

		<term>Section 2: Digital vs. Analog Measurements</term>
	</p>

	<p>

		An analog device is one that uses markings to measure a value. An example would be a clock with hand and markings for the hours and minutes.
	</p></fn> devices like a ruler or a graduated cylinder, the process for determining the number of significant figures in your measurement is more complicated than with a <term>digital</term><fn>	<p>
		A digital device is one that displays a measurement using digits only.
	</p></fn> device. <em>With a digital device, you simply record all of the displayed numbers in your measured number and obey the rules that were learned previously for significant figures in order to determine which digits are significant</em>. For example if a balance reads 0.320 grams, then your measurement is 0.320 grams with 3 significant figures (the left zero is NOT significant because of the rules you learned in the last section).
	</p>

	<p>
		When we use an analog device, we frequently see that the line that we’re measuring occurs between values on the measuring scale. When reporting these measurements, we report all of the digits that are provided by the measuring scale PLUS we estimate the value of one extra digit by mentally subdividing the scale into 10 equal portions. See the example below:
	</p>

	<figure>
	<image source="media/image11.png"/>
		<caption>A graph with a red arrow Description automatically generated</caption>
</figure>

	<p>
		If we’re trying to measure the length of the orange arrow the scale provided depicts tenths of a unit (let’s say it’s centimeters). The orange arrow appears to be between 0.9 and 1 cm long. Since this is an analog scale, we should ALWAYS estimate one extra significant digit, even if that digit is a 0. In this case, my estimate would be 0.94 cm, but yours might differ slightly (though it should be 0.9 something).
	</p>

	<figure>
	<image source="media/image20.png"/>
		<caption>A line with numbers and a line with a line AI-generated content may be incorrect.</caption>
</figure>

	<p>
		In this case not all of the digits in the tenths place are shown, only 0.5. Because of this we don’t estimate an extra decimal place. Instead we estimate for the decimal place shown by the most precise markings, in this case the tenths place. My estimate would be 0.9 cm. Your estimate might be 0.8 cm or even 1.0 cm.

	<p>
		<term>Section 3: Significant figures in calculations</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		What do we do if we have to do calculations that involve measured numbers? For instance, what if three different students measure the orange arrow above and we are asked to compute the average of those measurements? For instance, if the three students measured the line to be 0.92 cm, 0.94 cm, and 0.95 cm, then the average from your calculator would be 0.9366666666…cm. Do we know the average that precisely? In order to do figure out the number of significant figures in this case, we have to learn rules for significant figures in calculations as well as how to round.
	</p>

	<p>
		We’ll start with rounding. If your calculator were to display the answer to a calculation as 9.874030234 and you have to round it to 3 significant figures, your first step is to identify the first 3 significant figures in the number, starting from the left (in this case 9.87). You then look at the next digit to the right (in this case a 4). If that digit is 0-4, you don’t round up the figures that you are keeping. If it is 5-9, then you round up the rightmost kept significant figure. In this case, since the digit is a 4, we would not round up the 7 in 9.87…so the final rounded number should be 9.87. In contrast, if we were trying to round 9.9987 to 4 significant figures, then we’d keep the 9.998, look at the next digit (which is a 7). This would cause us to round up the 8, which would result in an answer of 9.999.
	</p>

	<p>
		The rules for calculations are divided into 3 parts: rules for addition/subtraction, rules for multiplication, and rules for logarithms and exponents. In this chapter, we’ll cover the first two sets of rules only. The rule for logarithms and exponents will be covered in a later chapter.
	</p>

	<p>
		The multiplication/division rule is the most common that we use in this class. <em>The rule states that the answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value that had the fewest.</em> Thus, if we multiply the measured numbers of 4.5, 0.3, and 9.888, we get a calculator answer of 13.3488. This should be rounded to 1 significant figure because our starting values had 2, 1, and 4 significant figures respectively and the rule states that our answer should have the same number of significant figures as our starting value that had the least (in this case 1). So our final reported value should be 10.
	</p>

	<p>
		When adding and subtracting, the number of significant figures does not matter. What matters is the digit place of the most precise significant figure in each number. What do I mean by the most precise significant figure…consider the measured number 4.432 ft. In this case the 2 is the most precise significant figure because it represents the smallest level of detail. <em>When adding or subtracting the rule states that the final answer’s most precise significant figure should be in the same digit place as the starting value with the least most precise significant figure</em> (that’s a mouthful…but it’s easy to demonstrate).
	</p>

	<p>
		If you were adding the following measured numbers: 0.34, 0.0002, and 15.3 our calculator would display 15.6402. The question is then how should we round this number? The most precise significant figures in each of our starting numbers are 4, 2, and 3 respectively (each is highlighted in yellow). The 4 is in the hundredths place, the 2 in the ten thousandths, and the 3 in the tenths. Out of those options, the tenths place is the least significant place and so our final number will be rounded to the tenths place, giving us 15.6. This is easily demonstrated by lining the values up vertically and rounding the final answer to the most significant digit <image source='media/image6.png'/>place that is furthest to the left.
	</p>

	<p>
		What if a calculation requires both addition and multiplication? In that case, the best practice is to save the rounding for the very end. Do NOT round along the way or you may introduce errors. What you need to do is think about what the rounding would look like after each step in order and then round the final answer based on that. For instance, if you were averaging the measurements 9.87, 9.99, and 9.64 grams, you would need to add them and then divide by 3. If you add them you get 29.5 on most calculators, but you should be thinking about what place that should be rounded to…in this case the hundredths place. That number 29.5 (or 29.50) would then be divided by 3. In this case, 3 is an exact number with an infinite number of significant figures because you are averaging <em>exactly</em> 3 numbers. You calculator might display 9.83333333. The question is how many significant figures should we keep? The addition step should have given us 4 significant figures. The division step involved a number with 4 significant figures and another with an infinite number. Thus our final answer should have 4 significant figures (9.833 grams).
	</p>

	<p>
		A helpful way for keeping track of this is to circle the digit place that should be rounded to after each step in the calculation (even though we won’t round until the end. This can help you keep track of how many significant figures each number has (or which digit place the most precise digit is in) for each number along the way. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		Compute the following and round to the correct number of significant figures. Assume each number shown in the original calculation is a measured number.
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>(0.995 + 1.0) \times 22.0 \div 4.30 = ?</me>
