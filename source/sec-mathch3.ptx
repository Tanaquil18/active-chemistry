	<p>
		Success in chemistry is often heavily dependent on math skills. This can be intimidating to many students. I want to assure you that the required level of math is actually quite doable, but you need to practice it! In fact, much of the math that we regularly do in chemistry is quite similar to non-chemistry problems that you easily do without much thought. The first exercise deals with some of these sorts of problems and builds up the complexity.

		<term>Section 2: Conversion factors</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Anytime we are converting from one type of unit to another, we use conversion factors, even if we don’t realize that’s what we’re doing. <term>Conversion factors</term> <fn>	<p>
		Conversion factors are ratios between two different quantities. They are expressed as a fraction and are used as factors in dimensional analysis problems.
	</p></fn>are fractions that express the relationship between two different units as a fraction. For instance, the relationship between feet and inches can be expressed by an equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>12\ \text{inches} = 1\ \text{foot}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This same relationship can be expressed as a conversion factor by taking one side of the equation and placing it over the other side as a fraction:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\left( \frac{\text{12 inches}}{\text{1 foot}} \right)\ or\ \left( \frac{\text{1 foot}}{\text{12 inches}} \right)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		By multiplying these conversion factors with a given quantity, we can cancel out the units we don’t want, leaving us with the ones that we do.
	</p>

	<p>
		Conversion factors are often provided in chemistry problems. For instance, the density of a substance may be provided as 220 grams per liter (or written out using abbreviations as 220 g/L). In either case, this quantity should be written as a fraction, allowing it to be used as a conversion factor:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{220\ grams}{1\ liter}\ or\ \frac{1\ liter}{220\ grams}</me>
	</p>

		<term>Question:</term> A factory needs to purchase grease for its machines. Each machine needs 5.0 ounces of grease every day. The factory has 35 of these machines. If a package of grease contains 75.0 ounces of grease, how many packages would be needed for the factory for a week?
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Starting information</term>—We have choices here.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Option 1:</em> Generally I recommend that students try to start with a provided quantity that is NOT a conversion factor (ie. not a fraction). In this case our starting information is:
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>\frac{5.0\ ounces}{machine \bullet day}</m> 35 machines <m>\frac{75.0\ ounces}{1\ package}</m> 1 week
	</p>

	<p>
		Given these choices I’d recommend starting with 35 machines. You could start with 1 week if you wanted to.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Option 2</em>: If one of the pieces of starting information has your desired unit, you can start with that, but make sure that the desired unit is in the numerator. In this case you could flip the <m>\frac{75.0\ ounces}{1\ package}</m> to be <m>\frac{1\ package}{75.0\ ounces}</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Desired end units</term>—packages
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Relevant equation and conversion factors</term>—
	</p>

	<p>
		In this case the quantities and conversion factors listed above are almost sufficient. We have machines in the units of two quantities (35 machines and <m>\frac{5.0\ ounces}{machine \bullet day}</m>). The same is true for ounces. The unit “package” only appears in one place, but that’s okay because we don’t want to cancel it out. The units “day” and “week”, however, only appear once and need to cancel out. Therefore we need the additional conversion factor:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{7\ days}{1\ week}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Pathway</term>—we want to eliminate all of the units except “packages”. All of the other units must appear once in the numerator and denominator so that they cancel out.
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Calculation</term>—
	</p>

	<p>
		Option 1:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>35\ machines\ \left( \frac{5.0\ ounces}{machine \bullet day} \right)\left( \frac{7\ days}{1\ week} \right)(1\ week)\left( \frac{1\ package}{75.0\ ounces} \right) = \frac{35 \times 5 \times 7\ \ packages}{75} = 16.3333333\ packages</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Option 2:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\left( \frac{1\ package}{75.0\ ounces} \right)\ \left( \frac{5.0\ ounces}{machine \bullet day} \right)(35\ machines)\left( \frac{7\ days}{1\ week} \right)(1\ week) = \frac{35 \times 5 \times 7\ \ packages}{75} = 16.3333333\ packages</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Rounding to the correct number of significant figures</term>—
	</p>

	<p>
		16.3 packages

	<p>
		We very often have to write conversion factors that will allow us to convert between SI units with different prefixes. How do we do this? Let’s say that we want to convert 122 nm into mm. We need a conversion factor that equates nm and mm. We can do this by writing the following equations that relate the starting and end units to the base unit of meters:
	</p>

	<p>
		1nm=10<sup>-9</sup>m and 1mm=10<sup>-3</sup>m
	</p>

	<p>
		We can then write conversion factors for both equations:
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>\frac{1nm}{10^{- 9}m}</m> and <m>\frac{1mm}{10^{- 3}m}</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		With our starting value of 122nm, we can see that all of the units (nm and m) except for mm occur twice and we can thus cancel them out if we flip and arrange the conversion factors appropriately:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>122nm\ \left( \frac{10^{- 9}m}{1nm} \right)\left( \frac{1mm}{10^{- 3}m} \right) = 1.22 \times 10^{- 4}mm</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		There is one additional complication that can come up with unit conversions, namely when dealing with units of area or volume. The problem that arises is that scientists often use units of distance that are squared (ex. km<sup>2</sup>) or cubed (ex. cm<sup>3</sup>). To convert between squared units we must remember that the unit is actually there twice (and likewise for units of volume, where the distance is cubed, that the distance unit is there three times). See below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>1.0cm^{2} = 1.0\ cm \bullet cm</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus if we are converting between different units, we must do the conversion two or even three times to cancel out each of the starting units. So, if you were asked to convert 2.3 dm<sup>3</sup> to m<sup>3</sup> you would do the following:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>2.3\ dm^{3} = 2.3\ dm \bullet dm \bullet dm\left( \frac{10^{- 1}m}{dm} \right)\left( \frac{10^{- 1}m}{dm} \right)\left( \frac{10^{- 1}m}{dm} \right) = 0.0023m^{3}</me>
