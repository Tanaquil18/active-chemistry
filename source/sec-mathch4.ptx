		You are trying to identify a metal based on its density. You first measure its mass as 17.50g. You then obtain a graduated cylinder and fill it with 23.21 mL of water. You then put the piece of metal in the water and measure a volume of 24.75 mL. Calculate its density.
	</p>

			<p>

				<li>
					<p>
						You have the mass and the volumes of water in the graduated cylinder before and after adding the metal

					<p>
						D=m/V (you have mass but not volume of the object itself)
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<term>Recognize that you need to calculate the volume</term>
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Volume of the object= 24.75mL-23.21mL= 1.54mL
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>

		<li>
			<p>
				<term>Calculate and round appropriately</term>
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>D = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{17.50g}{1.54mL} = 11.363636\frac{g}{mL}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Recall that solids usually have density units of g/cm3. Since 1mL=1cm<sup>3</sup> then density can be written as <m>11.363636\frac{g}{cm^{3}}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						This involved multiple steps, subtraction then division. The subtraction step would have had us round to the hundredths place resulting in 3 significant figures (1.54). If we do division next, we have one number with 3 significant figures (the volume) and one with 4 (the mass). Therefore we should round to 3 significant figures giving <m>11.4\frac{g}{cm^{3}}</m>; this corresponds to the density of lead.

		<term>Section 2: Dosage Problems</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The medical field uses dimensional analysis a lot when calculating the amount of pharmaceuticals a patient should receive. Often patients are supposed to receive a certain <term>dosage</term><fn>	<p>
		The plan for how much drug should be given to a patient. This can include information about the patient’s weight and the frequency of the administration of the drug.
	</p></fn>; doses that are under that amount may be ineffective and doses that exceed that amount may produce toxic effects. For many drugs, the dosage is expressed as a ratio of mass of drug to kilograms of the patient’s body weight (example units might be mg/kg; this means mg of drug per kilogram of body weight). <em>Remember that dosage amounts are regarded as being exact numbers for the purpose of calculations!</em> Using the dosage and additional information about the patient (such as their weight), we can calculate the correct <term>dose</term><fn>	<p>
		The exact amount of a drug that should be given to a certain patient
	</p></fn> of the drug to administer to them. Additionally, many drugs are available as <term>solutions</term><fn>	<p>
		A solution is a mixture of substances where one is dissolved in another. Frequently a solid is dissolved into a liquid in a solution. An example is salt water.
	</p></fn>, where a certain amount of drug is dissolved in a specific amount of liquid. The amount of drug that is present in a given amount of liquid is called the <term>concentration</term><fn>	<p>
		The amount of drug that is contained in a specific volume of solution.
	</p></fn> (example units might be mg/mL; this means mg of drug in a mL of solution). These dose amounts and concentrations are often used as conversion factors to determine the appropriate amount of drug to administer to a patient. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		If a patient is supposed to receive a dose of drug X of 15mg/kg, how many mL of solution will you have to administer if the patient weighs 75 kg and the solution contains 30.0mg/mL drug X?
