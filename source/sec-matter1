		<term>Section 1: Classification of matter</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		There are different ways to classify matter, but this diagram is one that that can help you compartmentalize your knowledge throughout the course. The diagram strives to classify matter according to its complexity and arrangement. This sort of classification has historical importance to chemistry because it what allowed scientists to begin to gain an understanding of what matter is made of. For instance, it is essential to know what an element is in order to understand that a compound is made up of elements.
	</p>

	<p>
		The highest classes of matter on the chart are <term>mixtures</term><fn>	<p>
		Matter that consists of multiple pure substances. The pure substances can be separated by physical processes.
	</p></fn> and <term>pure substances</term><fn>	<p>
		Matter that cannot be separated into different components by physical processes.
	</p></fn>. The difference between these terms is that mixtures consist of multiple substances, while pure substances are only one. The difference between these can be obvious, but that isn’t always the case. For instance, you can clearly see that a glass of sand and water contains multiple substances because we can see the sand and the water and they clearly appear to be different. In the case of salt water, it would be difficult to determine whether it’s a mixture of substances (water and salt) by simply looking at it. Sugar, is a pure substance, but brass is not…so how do we know that something is a pure substance or a mixture?
	</p>

	<p>
		This is not as straightforward as it might initially seem, but we can come up with rules to help us out. A mixture contains two different substances AND those substances can be separated by <term>physical processes</term><fn>	<p>
		Physical processes are ones that don’t change the identity of a substance.
	</p></fn>. A physical process is a one that doesn’t need other substances to be added. Also a physical process will preserve the identity and characteristics of each of the components. Easy examples are boiling and freezing a liquid. The identity of that liquid is the same if it’s a solid, liquid, or gas despite it having somewhat different characteristics. Other examples of physical processes include filtering, cutting, sorting, etc. Sand and water can be separated by filtration, a physical process, and therefore sandy water is classified as a mixture. In the example of salt water we know that it is a mixture because we can separate it into its components (salt and water) by boiling the water and taking advantage of the fact that salt and water have different <term>physical properties</term><fn>	<p>
		Physical properties are properties of a material that can be discovered while preserving the identity of the substance
	</p></fn><term>.</term> A physical property is a property (like boiling point, freezing point, size, color, etc.) that can be observed without altering the chemical identity of a substance.
	</p>

	<p>
		Within the category of mixtures, we have <term>homogenous mixtures</term><fn>	<p>
		Homogeneous mixtures consist of two or more pure substances that are mixed in a uniform manner.
	</p></fn> and <term>heterogenous mixtures</term><fn>	<p>
		Heterogeneous mixtures consist of two or more pure substances that are mixed in a non-uniform manner
	</p></fn>. The difference between these terms deals with the arrangement of the components. If the components are evenly distributed throughout the mixture, then we have a homogeneous mixture. If the arrangement is not uniform, then it’s a heterogeneous mixture. Heterogeneous mixtures are sometimes obvious, like sand in water; if you let it sit for a little while the sand settles to the bottom. Sometimes heterogeneous mixtures are not immediately identifiable as such. Consider blood; it initially looks like a uniform red liquid. However, if you let it sit for a little while, the cells in the blood will soon settle to the bottom of the container, similar to sand in water.
	</p>

	<p>
		In a homogeneous mixture, the various substances are evenly distributed, even at a microscopic level. Because of this, you will not see the various particles that make up a homogeneous mixture. <term>Solutions</term><fn>	<p>
		A homogeneous mixture where one pure substance is dissolved into another
	</p></fn> are homogeneous mixtures where one substance (the <term>solute</term><fn>	<p>
		The lesser component of a solution is called the solute
	</p></fn>) is dissolved in a larger amount of the second substance (the <term>solvent</term><fn>	<p>
		The major component of a solution is called the solvent
	</p></fn>). The solvent and the solute can be the same state of matter or different states. For instance, oxygen gas can be dissolved in water, forming a solution. Salt can also be dissolved in water. Gases can be dissolved in one another (for example, air is a solution where small amounts of oxygen gas, carbon dioxide, etc. are dissolved in the solvent of nitrogen gas). There are also solutions made of metals, and these are called <term>alloys</term><fn>	<p>
		Homogeneous mixtures of metals are called alloys
	</p></fn>. Bronze is a mixture of zinc and copper where the two substances have so fully dispersed that the mixture is now uniform. Homogenous mixtures can still be separated by physical processes, but they often require more effort (ex. many heterogeneous mixtures can be separated by filtration, whereas a homogenous mixture may require boiling, condensing, or melting).
	</p>

	<p>
		Pure substances, on the other hand, cannot be separated by physical processes. If you boil pure liquid water, it will be entirely converted into water vapor. If you condense the water vapor it will entirely turn back into liquid water. In both cases, there isn’t any substance that is separated from the water or water vapor by carrying out these physical processes; the substance remains unchanged. Physical processes cannot change the composition of a pure substance. The discovery of pure substances and their further classification into elements and compounds was essential to our understanding of the composition of the world around us. This will be further explored in the next section.

		<term>Section 2: Relationship between elements and compounds</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Pure substances can be subdivided into <term>elements</term><fn>	<p>
		Elements are pure substances that cannot be broken down further by chemical processes
	</p></fn> and <term>compounds</term><fn>	<p>
		Compounds are pure substances that consist of two or more elements. They can only be separated into their component elements by chemical processes.
	</p></fn><term>.</term> The distinction between elements and compounds depends on whether they can be broken down into simpler units by <term>chemical processes</term><fn>	<p>
		A chemical process is a reaction that changes the identity of a substance
	</p></fn>. A chemical process is a reaction that often (but not always) involves the addition of one or more additional reactants and always results in the chemical identity of the starting substance changing. Chemical processes may result in a significant change in the appearance of the starting substance or evolution of a gas, but in other cases there may be little obvious indication that a reaction has occurred (that’s a subject that is covered in other classes like organic chemistry in much more detail). If a pure substance can be broken down into simpler units by a chemical process, then we’re dealing with a compound. If it can’t, then we’re dealing with an element.
	</p>

	<p>
		We now know of the existence of over 100 different elements. Each element can be found arranged in the <term>periodic table</term><fn>	<p>
		An organized table that displays the elements and additional information about each one.
	</p></fn> (more about the periodic table in a later chapter). If you can find a substance in the periodic table, then it’s an element. The cells in the periodic table contain information about each element. For right now, we’ll focus on the name each element as well as its <term>element symbol</term><fn>	<p>
		An abbreviation for an element consisting of one or more letters
	</p></fn>, a short abbreviation that is used to represent that element (example: H is the element symbol for hydrogen). Many of these element symbols make sense with the English name of the element. Other element symbols are derived from the Latin name of the element (example: sodium is called natrium in Latin and its symbol is Na).
	</p>

	<p>
		What then is the relationship between an element and a compound. This relationship was one of the key discoveries in chemistry, and its discovery opened up our understanding of the foundational composition of all matter. One of these early insights came from the discovery of the <term>Law of constant composition</term><fn>	<p>
		The law of constant composition states that the ratio of elements in a compound is always a constant
	</p></fn>. This law states that compounds always have the same ratio of elements. For instance, water always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 8 grams of oxygen. Methane, another compound, always has a ratio of 1 gram of hydrogen for every 3 grams of carbon. This discovery showed scientists that compounds were comprised of elements in very specific ratios.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next key discovery came from comparing the ratios of elements in one compound to the ratios found in other compounds where both compounds consisted of the same elements. For instance, methane has a 1:3 ratio between the mass of hydrogen and the mass of carbon as stated in the previous paragraph. Ethane is another compound made of carbon and hydrogen, but the ratio between hydrogen and carbon is 1:4. If we divide these two ratios <m>\left( \frac{1\ g\ hydrogen}{3\ g\ carbon} \div \frac{1\ g\ hydrogen}{4\ g\ carbon} = \frac{1\ g\ hydrogen}{3\ g\ carbon} \times \frac{4\ g\ carbon}{1\ g\ hydrogen} = \frac{4}{3} \right)\ </m>we get a ratio of 4:3, meaning that ethane contains 4/3 as much carbon as methane. This can be done for many other pairs of compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. If we do this, we get other ratios like 1:2, 1:3, or 3:2. In every case, we begin to see that when we divide the ratios of carbon and hydrogen between two compounds, we always get <em>ratios of integers</em>! This is known as the <term>Law of multiple proportions</term><fn>	<p>
		The law of multiple proportions states that if you divide the ratios of elements for two different compounds that contain the same elements, you will always get a ratio of integers
	</p></fn><term>.</term> The realization that there are integer relationships between the composition of different compounds means that the carbon and hydrogen in these compounds occurs in <em>discrete countable units</em>. These discrete countable units are called <term>atoms</term><fn>	<p>
		The smallest unit of an element.
	</p></fn>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks to the Law of constant composition and the law of multiple proportions, we now know that all compounds are comprised of atoms of various elements that are combined together a specific ratio. This ratio can be written as a <term>chemical formula</term><fn>	<p>
		A way of showing how many atoms of a given element make up a single unit of a chemical compound
	</p></fn><term>.</term> The formula for a compound is written by listing the element symbol followed by a subscript number indicating the number of atoms of that element that comprise the compound’s formula unit (please note, that if there is only one atom of a particular type that the number 1 is NOT written). So Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> has 2 sodium atoms, one sulfur atom, and 4 oxygen atoms in every unit of that compound.

	<p>
		<term>Section 3: States of matter</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		The <term>states of matter</term><fn>	<p>
		Three different forms that matter can adopt while preserving its identity. The states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.
	</p></fn> are solids, liquids, and gases. When a substance undergoes a change in its state, it still retains its same chemical identity, and thus state changes are reversible. Water still has its same chemical formula and identity regardless of whether it is ice, liquid water, or water vapor. Each of these states has different properties, but they are properties of that state, not of water itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		The properties that define a <term>solid</term><fn>	<p>
		A state of matter that has a fixed shape and a fixed volume
	</p></fn> are that it has a fixed shape and volume. Solids do not flow. They can change shape but require some outside force to cause this to happen (like bending a nail with a hammer). On a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the particles that make up the solid are held together by forces that are so strong that the particles can’t move past one another. As a result, the arrangement of the particles is fixed, and the shape of the substance as a whole remains fixed.
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Liquids</term><fn>	<p>
		A state of matter that can flow and has a fixed volume but a variable shape. It will take on the shape of its container
	</p></fn>, on the other hand, have a fixed volume, but not a fixed shape. They will take on the shape of their container. Liquids can flow and move in response to gravity. On a microscopic scale, the reason for these properties is that the attractive forces between the particles are strong enough to maintain contact between the particles but weak enough that the particles can move past one another. As a result, the entire liquid is capable of movement and flow. At the same time, the attraction between the particles ensures that they never fully separate, so the volume remains fixed regardless of the shape.
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Gases</term><fn>	<p>
		A state of matter that has a variable shape and volume. A gas will take on the shape and volume of its container
	</p></fn> have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. A gas will always fill up the entirety of the container that it is placed in. Gases can flow like liquids, but their component particles have enough energy that they can flow in all directions, completely filling up their container. The microscopic reason for these properties is that the particles in a gas are moving so rapidly past one another that they don’t interact at all (in actuality, there are very small interactions between gas particles, but chemists often ignore this). As a result a gas will always spread out to occupy the entirety of its container, meaning that a gas will not have a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.
	</p>

	<p>
		The reason for the differences between the states of matter is that the particles that make them up have different amounts of <term>kinetic energy</term><fn>	<p>
		Energy of motion
	</p></fn>. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is affected by both the mass of an object and its velocity (ex. a baseball thrown by a toddler will hurt a lot less than by one thrown by a professional pitcher due to the difference in velocity and hence the difference in kinetic energy). The particles in a gas are moving much faster than those in a liquid; the particles in a liquid are moving much faster than those in a solid. Because of this, we can conclude that the particles in a gas have more kinetic energy than those in a liquid and that those in a liquid have more have more kinetic energy than those in a solid. So in order to turn a solid into a liquid (<term>melting</term><fn>	<p>
		The process of converting a substance from a solid to a liquid
	</p></fn>), we have to add energy to the substance by heating it. The same is true for turning a liquid into a gas (<term>boiling</term><fn>	<p>
		The process of converting a substance from a liquid to a gas.
	</p></fn> or <term>vaporizing</term><fn>	<p>
		Same as boiling
	</p></fn>). If we want to turn a gas into a liquid (<term>condensing</term><fn>	<p>
		The process of converting a gas into a liquid
	</p></fn>) we have to remove kinetic energy from the substance by cooling it. The same is true for <term>freezing</term><fn>	<p>
		The process of converting a liquid into a solid
	</p></fn> a substance (the process of turning a liquid into a solid).
