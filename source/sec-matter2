		<term>Section 1: Energy, heat and temperature</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		You just learned about kinetic energy, but was is energy itself? In order to understand energy, we must first define <term>work</term><fn>	<p>
		Applying a force to an object over some distance
	</p></fn>. Work is when a force is applied to an object over some distance. <term>Energy</term><fn>	<p>
		The capacity of an object to do work or produce heat or light
	</p></fn> is a property of an object or substance that describes its ability to do work, or to produce light or heat. Energy is a very important consideration in chemistry. It influences the properties of matter, including its state and temperature. Additionally, energy may be released or consumed by reactions. All reactions require energy input to occur, and some require so much energy that they won’t occur unless the reaction is heated or there is a spark (ex. a mixture of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas will not react with one another unless the reaction is provided with a flame or spark to get it going).
	</p>

	<p>
		Energy can be subdivided into two classes: <term>kinetic energy</term><fn>	<p>
		Energy of motion
	</p></fn> and <term>potential energy</term><fn>	<p>
		Stored energy
	</p></fn>. Kinetic energy is energy of motion or vibration. Potential energy is stored energy that could potentially be converted into kinetic energy. A classic physics example is that a boulder sitting on a small hill has a small amount of potential energy compared to the same boulder sitting on top of a mountain. Due to the height difference, the boulder would speed up more if it were pushed off the mountain than a small hill. Once the boulder is pushed, the potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy. In chemistry, we’re not usually thinking about boulders rolling down hills. Instead, energy is stored in the form of <term>bonds</term><fn>	<p>
		Forces that hold atoms or molecules together
	</p></fn> that join atoms and molecules together. When this energy is released, the motion of the atoms or molecules increases.
	</p>

	<p>
		The movement of atoms and molecules, including rotations and vibrations, is chemical kinetic energy. When we measure <term>temperature</term><fn>	<p>
		Quantification of the amount of kinetic energy contained in the molecules of an object
	</p></fn> what we are measuring is the amount of chemical kinetic energy in a substance. As energy is added to a substance, the temperature generally increases, and this is due to increased motion of the particles that make it up.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both energy and temperature are quantifiable in chemistry. The SI units of energy are joules. In this course, due to its focus on health sciences, we will more commonly use the unit of calorie (1 calorie = 4.184 joules). The unit calories (abbreviate cal) can use the metric prefixes that you’ve previously learned with the most commonly version being a kilocalorie, or kcal. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy that will raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. When we’re dealing with the energy content of food, we often use units of Calories (note that it is now capitalized). 1 Calorie is equivalent to 1kcal or 1000 calories.
	</p>

	<p>
		For temperature, we have 2 units that are commonly used by society (Fahrenheit and Celsius) and another that is used extensively in science (Kelvin). Fahrenheit is related to Celsius by the following formula:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>℉ = 1.8 \times ℃ + 32</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this formula, the 1.8 and 32 are EXACT numbers. Kelvin is a temperature scale that has its zero point at absolute zero (ie. the coldest possible temperature where there is no motion). To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, we use the following formula:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>K = ℃ + 273.15</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Kelvin will always have a positive value, and for this reason, it often must be used as the unit of temperature in scientific formulas. Using these two formulae, we can easily convert between different temperature units by using some algebra skills:
	</p>

	<p>
		Example: Express the temperature <m>53℉</m> in Celsius and Kelvin.
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				We have a formula to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius and another formula to go from Celsius to Kelvin. Let’s determine Celsius first, then Kelvin.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Let’s plug in the temperature in Fahrenheit and then rearrange the equation to solve for Celsius:
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>℉ = 1.8 \times ℃ + 32</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>53 = 1.8 \times ℃ + 32</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>53 - 32 = 1.8 \times ℃ + 32 - 32</m> (Subtract 32 from both sides)
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>21 = 1.8 \times ℃</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>\frac{21}{1.8} = \frac{1.8 \times ℃}{1.8}</m> (Divide both sides by 1.8)
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>11.66666 = ℃</m> (Round to correct number of significant figures)
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>12\ degrees\ Celsius = ℃</me>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Now take the temperature in Celsius and plug it into the formula to solve for Kelvin:
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>K = ℃ + 273.15</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>K = 12 + 273.15</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>K = 285.15</m> (Round to the correct number of significant figures)
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>K = 285\ Kelvin</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		With 3 different temperature scales, it’s important to have an idea of how hot values are in each of them. You should know the following values in each unit of temperature:

		<term>Section 2: Food energy</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When we buy food at the grocery store, it has the amount of energy that our bodies can obtain from digestion printed on the label in the form of Calories (note: that it is capitalized). This value is obtained by calculating the amount of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the food. Carbohydrates and proteins both contain 4 Calories of energy for every gram. Fats, on the other hand, have more energy, containing 9 Calories in every gram (consider the 4 and 9 to be exact numbers, even though they are technically measured). If we know how many grams of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat are in a serving of food, we can calculate how many Calories it contains. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		A serving of food contains 3.0 g of carbohydrates, 5.0 g of fat, and 17 g of protein. How many Calories are in a serving?
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				We want to determine how many Calories come from each class of biomolecule and then add those values together to get the total.
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						We need to use dimensional analysis:
					</p>
				
					<p><ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Carbohydrates: <m>3.0\ g\ \left( \frac{4\ Calories}{g} \right) = 12\ Calories</m>
							</p>
						</li>
				
						<li>
							<p>
								Fat: <m>5.0\ g\ \left( \frac{9\ Calories}{g} \right) = 45\ Calories</m>
							</p>
						</li>
				
						<li>
							<p>
								Protein: <m>17\ g\left( \frac{4\ Calories}{g} \right) = 68\ Calories</m>
							</p>
						</li>
				
					</ol></p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						Then add: <m>12\ Cal + 45\ Cal + 68\ Cal = 125\ Calories</m>
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>

		<term>Section 3: Electromagnetic radiation</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When we are talking about energy in chemistry, one common way in which energy can be released or taken up by matter is in the form of <term>electromagnetic radiation</term><fn>	<p>
		A form of energy that can travel through space as a wave of electrical and magnetic fields
	</p></fn>. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that can travel through space as both a wave and a particle called a <term>photon</term><fn>	<p>
		A massless particle of electromagnetic radiation. They are the smallest unit of electromagnetic radiation.
	</p></fn>. We all experience electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is one form of electromagnetic radiation. However, even blind people are able to experience non-visible forms of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared rays (think about how light from the sun makes things hot…a lot of this is due to infrared radiation). There are several different forms of electromagnetic radiation: gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves.
	</p>

	<p>
		Electromagnetic radiation exists as a wave. Waves can be depicted graphically as shown below. Note the definition of a <term>wavelength</term><fn>	<p>
		The distance between two identical points of a wave.
	</p></fn> depicted in the drawing below. A wavelength is the distance between two identical points on different parts of the same wave. The list of forms of electromagnetic radiation listed in the paragraph above (gamma rays, x-rays, UV rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves) are arranged in order of increasing wavelengths. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths (meters or even kilometers long) and gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths (&lt;0.01 nanometers).
	</p>

	<figure>
	<image source="media/image1.wmf"/>
		<caption></caption>
</figure>

	<p>
		The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is related to two other properties: energy and <term>frequency</term><fn>	<p>
		The number of waves that pass a certain point in a specific amount of time (usually 1 second)
	</p></fn>. The shorter the wavelength, the more energy that the electromagnetic radiation has. You can try to understand this by thinking about trying to vibrate a stretched out spring…you don’t have to use much energy to get the spring to vibrate slowly (long wavelengths), but you have to expend a lot of energy to get the spring to vibrate quickly (short wavelengths). An in-class demonstration can be helpful here. Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a certain point every second. Electromagnetic radiation, regardless of the type, travels with the same speed (known as the speed of light). If the waves are spaced close together, then more waves will pass by every second compared to a case where the waves are further apart. As a result, light with a long wavelength will have low frequencies. The exercises below will help you to visualize this.
