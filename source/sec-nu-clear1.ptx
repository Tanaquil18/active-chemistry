		<term>Types of radioactivity</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this chapter, we’ll be exploring <term>radiation</term> and <term>radioactivity</term>. Radiation is the emission of energy from an object in the form of electromagnetic radiation (which we covered previously) or in the form of parts of atoms. Importantly, radiation doesn’t imply a specific cause for the energy emission. Radioactivity produces radiation, but from a very specific source. In radioactivity, an atom has an unstable nucleus, and that nucleus becomes stable, and in the process releases radiation. There are other sources of radiation other than radioactivity. Radioactivity will always produce radiation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now that we’ve clarified those two terms, let’s begin to learn about radioactivity in more detail. In the last chapter, we learned about isotopes. To review, isotopes are atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons and thus different mass numbers. Some isotopes of atoms are stable, whereas other isotopes have unstable nuclei. These nuclei can stabilize themselves by emitting energy or particles. This is called radioactive decay. Radioactive decay causes that isotope to emit radiation. The radiation that is emitted can be different for different isotopes. forms that we’ll be learning about, because of their relevance to medicine are gamma radiation, beta particles, alpha particles, neutrons, protons, and positrons.
	</p>

	<p>
		What are these different forms of radiation. We’ve previously learned about gamma rays. Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation or light energy. Out of the different forms of electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays have the highest energies. The other forms of radiation that we’re going to cover are particles. It’s often helpful to group the particles together based on their similarities and differences.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some radioactive isotopes emit <term>gamma radiation</term>. This emission is in the form of a photon (or light) that has energy of a gamma ray. The emission of a gamma ray is caused by an unstable nucleus relaxing to a lower energy state and emitting the lost energy as light. Unlike the other types of radioactive emission, gamma rays are massless and lack charge.
	</p>

	<p>
		Other types of radioactive isotopes decay and emit particles. These types of particles are <term>alpha particles, beta particles, positrons, protons,</term> and <term>neutrons.</term> These particles vary in their mass and charge. Alpha particles have the greatest mass. They are essentially a helium atom nucleus. They consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons that are fused together into the largest of the particles that we’ll discuss. Beta particles are essentially electrons that are ejected from an atoms as a part of radioactive emission. However, they are ejected from the nucleus rather than from the cloud of electrons around the atom (we’ll discuss how this works more in the next section). Positrons are <term>antimatter</term> particles. They have the same mass as an electron, but they’re positively charged. When antimatter positrons collide with electrons, they <term>annihilate</term> one another and their mass is turned into energy in the form of gamma rays. We’ve already discussed protons and neutrons. Their masses and charges are the same that we’ve previously discussed, even when they are ejected from an atom as a part of radioactive decay.

		<term>Balancing decay reactions</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When radioactive decay occurs, changes happen to the radioactive atom. In most cases, the emission of the radiation results in a change in the nucleus of the atom and can even change one element into another element. To describe the changes that take place after radioactive decay, we can write a radioactive decay equation. The guiding principle when writing a radioactive decay equation is that the total mass and total charge cannot change after the decay has occurred.
	</p>

	<p>
		The first type of decay equation that we’ll explore is gamma decay. Unlike other forms of radioactivity, there is no change in the composition of the nucleus. Instead the nucleus simply changes from a high energy state (called a metastable state) to a low energy state. This makes balancing nuclear decay equations that involve gamma emission very easy. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>_{}^{125}I^{m} \rightarrow \ \gamma +^{125}I</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this equation, the superscript m indicates that the nucleus of iodine-125 is metastable (semi-stable/unstable). The Greek letter gamma is used to represent the emitted gamma ray.
	</p>

	<p>
		Two other types of radioactivity (which are quite similar) are beta particles and positrons. Beta particles and positrons are both particles that are emitted from the nucleus. Both of them have mass (although it is very small and often rounded to 0 amu, similar to an electron). Also, both beta particles and positrons have charge; beta particles are negatively charged while positrons are positively charged. When nuclei emit a particle that has charge, the remaining charge in the nucleus has to change; the charge that is emitted has to come from somewhere (it isn’t simply created). <em>This results in the nucleus having the same mass, but a different number of protons.</em> When the number of protons changes, the identity of the atom actually changes from one element to another. See the examples below:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<m>_{1}^{3}H \rightarrow \ _{- 1}^{0}e + \ _{2}^{3}{He}</m>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<m>_{9}^{18}F \rightarrow \ _{+ 1}^{0}e + \ _{8}^{18}O</m>
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Equation 1 represents a beta-particle emission. The symbol <m>_{- 1}^{0}e</m> represents the beta-particle and implies that it has 0 mass and an atomic number (or charge, since we’re focusing solely on the nucleus) of -1. Sometimes beta-particles are represented in other ways, such as <m>\beta^{-}\ </m>or <m>e^{-}</m>, but they mean the exact same thing. Equation 2 represents a positron emission with the <m>_{+ 1}^{0}e</m> representing the positron (other times it may be represented by <m>\beta^{+}</m> or <m>e^{+}</m>). Note that in both cases, the identity of the isotope changes after the particle is emitted. <em>This is because nuclear decay equations must balance both charge and mass on both sides of the equation.</em> Since beta-particles and positrons lack mass, the mass number of the resulting isotope remains the same as it was in the beginning (in equation 1 the mass is 3 before and after emission; in equation 2, the mass is 18 before and after emission). Now let’s talk about how we figure out the atomic number of the resulting isotope. First, recall that the atomic number of an atom is ALWAYS the number of protons in the nucleus. Since protons are positively charged, the atomic number also ALWAYS gives us the charge of the nucleus of an atom. So, in equation 1, the nucleus of hydrogen began with a charge of +1. Since a beta particle was emitted, and since it has a charge of -1 then the resulting nucleus must have a charge of +2 (because +2 +(-1)= +1). We can figure this out by making a simple equation that states that the charge on the left equals the charge on the right:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>1 = x + ( - 1)\ \ \ therefore\ x = 2</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		We can do the same for positron emission in equation 2:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>9 = x + 1\ \ \ therefore\ x = 8</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Once we know the atomic number of the resulting isotope (2 or 8 respectively in the examples above), then we can figure out which element they represent (He and O respectively).
	</p>

	<p>
		So how do positron and beta-particle emissions work? How is the number of protons changing? When a beta-particle is emitted, a neutron is actually changing into a beta-particle plus a proton. The negative charge of the beta particle balances out the positive charge of the proton, hence why they both come from a neutral particle. So every time a beta-particle is emitted the mass remains the same (because protons and neutrons have masses of 1 amu), but the number of protons increases by one and the number of neutrons decreases by one. When a positron is emitted, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron. Thus a proton is lost, and the atomic number decreases by one, but a new neutron appears to preserve the mass.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another type of radioactivity is an alpha particle. Alpha particles have mass and charge, specifically a mass of 4 amu and a charge of +2. They are therefore the same as a helium nucleus. When we are balancing a nuclear decay equation involving alpha particle emission, we need to make sure to balance both mass and charge. See the example below:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<m>_{92}^{238}U \rightarrow \ _{2}^{4}{He^{2 +}} + \ _{90}^{234}{Th}</m>
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Note that the mass numbers are balanced on both sides of the reaction arrow as are the atomic numbers (or nuclear charge). The alpha particle is denoted <m>_{2}^{4}{He^{2 +}}</m> in equation 3.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, radioactive decay can result in the ejection of protons or neutrons from the nucleus. When a proton decay occurs a <m>_{1}^{1}p</m> particle is ejected. When neutron decay occurs the ejected particle is <m>_{0}^{1}n</m>. The rules for writing the decay equations for other types of particles still applies in these cases. We simply need to ensure that the total nuclear charge is the same on both sides of the equation AND that the mass is the same on both sides of the equation as well.

		<term>Section 3: Uses of radioactive materials</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Radioactive materials have numerous uses in energy production, science, and medicine. We’ll cover a few as a part of this section.
	</p>

	<p>
		Nuclear power plants rely on isotopes that undergo neutron decay to initiate a process called <term>nuclear fission</term>. Nuclear fission is a different type of nuclear decay in which a nucleus splits. This splitting is caused by the impact of a high energy neutron (which is produced by neutron decay) on a nucleus. The impact results in an unstable nucleus that undergoes nuclear fission. When a nucleus splits, smaller nuclei are produced along with other neutrons. These neutrons can impact the nuclei of other atoms causing them to undergo nuclear fission. This leads to a <term>chain reaction</term> where the splitting of one nucleus leads to particles that can cause the splitting of other nuclei. Every time a nucleus undergoes fission, some of the mass of the nucleus is turned into energy. This energy can be used to heat water to a boil and the resulting steam can be used to turn a turbine and produce electricity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Nuclear power can produce vast amounts of power without the production of greenhouse gases. However, nuclear power generates a large amount of radioactive waste. The nuclei that are produced after fission are often radioactive themselves. This presents a challenge for us to figure out ways to safely store these waste products. In addition, the radioactive materials that are needed to cause the chain reactions (namely uranium-235) are a limited resource that requires a lot of effort to mine and purify.
	</p>

	<p>
		Radioactive isotopes are used in medicine as <term>tracers</term> or as therapeutics. Tracers are chemicals that can help doctors pinpoint the location of problems. In a PET scan, for instance, a patient is treated with isotopes that emit positrons. When positrons are emitted in the human body, they are quickly annihilated by the electrons in the surrounding tissues. This annihilation produces gamma rays that can be detected by specialized cameras. This allows doctors to detect the location of the positron emitting isotopes in the human body. For example, PET scans can be used to detect tumors. In this usage, the patient is fed radioactive sugar. Cancer cells take up sugar much more quickly than most tissues in the human body. As a result the radioactive isotopes accumulate in the tumor and begin emitting more positrons there. By detecting the resulting gamma rays, doctors can easily detect the precise location of a tumor.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another medical use of radioactive materials is in radiation therapy. In radiation therapy, radioactive materials are placed in or near a tumor. Radiation can impact the tumor, leading to destruction of the molecules in those cells and ultimately the death of those cells. Unfortunately the damage is hard to confine to the tumor, and often surrounding tissues are damaged in the process, resulting in side effects.
