		<term>Measuring radioactivity</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When concerning ourselves with radioactivity and safety, it’s always important to minimize the exposure of medical personnel and patients. Radioactivity has the potential to cause chemical changes to our cells which can lead to cell death, mutations, and cancer. One of the easiest ways to minimize our risk is to use the lowest amount of radioactive isotope possible. The question then arises…how do we measure radioactivity. Radioactivity can be measured by a variety of devices, depending on the type of emission. In all cases, the SI unit that is used to measure radioactivity is a <term>becquerel</term> (abbreviated Bq), which is the same as one radioactive decay (or disintegration) every second. The nuclei of a radioactive isotope will randomly decay, releasing radioactivity. If a sample contains more nuclei or is more enriched in radioactive nuclei (ie. there are more radioactive nuclei and fewer non-radioactive nuclei) then the sample will produce more radiation every second, leading to a higher Bq value. Another historically important unit of measure for radioactivity is a <term>Curie</term> (abbreviated Ci). A Curie is a much larger quantity than a becquerel and represents 3.7 x10<sup>10</sup> decays per second or that same number of becquerels. A Curie often represents a very large amount of radiation, so it’s common for laboratory personnel to use smaller metric prefixes along with Curies, such as mCi or µCi.
	</p>

	<p>
		The units of Curies and becquerels are used to describe how much radiation an object emits. The emission of radioactivity from an object moves in all directions, and thus a large percentage of that radiation may never enter the body of a patient or medical professional. To describe the amount of radiation that actually enters the body, scientists use a different unit called a <term>rad</term>. This unit has since been replaced by the SI unit of <term>grey (</term>abbreviated Gy; one Gy is the same as 100 rad).
	</p>

	<p>
		To quantify the damaging effects of absorbed radiation, scientists use the unit <term>rem</term> (radiation equivalent in man). Rem can be easily calculated from rad by multiplying it by a damage factor that is specific to the type of radioactive particle that’s being absorbed. In general, gamma rays, beta particles, and positrons cause the least amount of damage (and thus have a factor of 1), protons and neutrons cause moderate damage (and have a factor of 10), and alpha particles cause the most damage (and have a factor of 20). Another unit that is used to measure the effect of absorbed radiation is a <term>Sievert (abbreviated Sv)</term>. One Sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. How much radiation is too much? An average person receives about 3 mSv of radiation per year. A single x-ray or a CT scan subject a person to 0.1-10 mSv of radiation. At a dose of 50 mSv, there is a statistically detectable increase in a person’s cancer risk. Radiation sickness can begin to set in with doses of 0.5 Sv (notice the change from mSv with the previous doses). A dose of 3-4 Sv is generally fatal to ~50% of people who receive that high of a dose.

		<term>Radiation safety</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Radiation can pose safety risks to humans, but if users are careful, the health impacts can be minimized. In order to avoid harm from radiation, there are 3 things to consider:
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Amount of radiation used
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Time
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Distance
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Shielding
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Whenever radioactive materials or other radiation sources are used, we should be careful to use the least amount possible. As you’d expect, by using lower amounts of radioactive materials, we can lessen the total exposure to radiation as well as the total amount of possible damage.
	</p>

	<p>
		Likewise, biological damage from radiation can be lessened by spending the minimal amount of time in an environment with a radiation source. In general, the more time a person spends near a radiation source, the greater their exposure to radiation and therefore the greater the amount of biological damage that will occur.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another important consideration is the distance between the radioactive material (or radiation source) and the person being exposed. There is a mathematical relationship between the amount of radiation a person’s body absorbs and the distance from the radiation source. The intensity of radiation decreases by the square of the distance increase from the radiation source. If you are standing 2 m from a radiation source, you would receive ¼ the radiation exposure that you would receive if you were standing 1 m away. This is because the same amount of radiation becomes spread over a larger area as the distance increases. The impact of distance on radiation intensity is described by the inverse square law equation:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>I_{2} = I_{1}\left( \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}} \right)^{2}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Where <m>I_{1}</m> and <m>I_{2}</m> are the radiation intensities at the first (<m>d_{1}</m>) and second (<m>d_{2}</m>) distances respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, various forms of radiation can be blocked by different types of shielding. In general, the larger the particle and more charged it is, the less shielding required. Alpha particles, the most massive radioactive particles, can be blocked by a sheet of paper or by our outer layer of skin. For alpha particle emitters to cause biological damage, they must typically be ingested or incorporated into the body by some other means. Beta-particles can be shielded by about a centimeter of aluminum, plastic, or plexiglass. Neutrons (no charge) and gamma rays (no mass or charge) are much more difficult to shield. Radioactive sources that emit these forms of radiation often require lead or concrete shielding to block exposure.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Exercise 2:</em>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				List the 4 ways that we can help lessen our exposure to radiation when working with radioactive materials
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				What type of radiation is the easiest to block with shielding? Which types are the hardest to block?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Think about what you know about the mass and charge of each of the types of radiation. How does that information relate to how easy it is to block that type of radiation?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				A person would be exposed to 4.0 mGy of radiation if they were 10.0 m from the radiation source. How much radiation would they be exposed to if they were instead:
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						20.0 m from the radiation source
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						100. m from the radiation source
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						2.5 m from the radiation source
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Rearrange the equation below to solve for <m>d_{2}</m>:
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>I_{2} = I_{1}\left( \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}} \right)^{2}</me>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Use the rearranged equation in question 5 to answer the following question: A worker needs to keep their radiation exposure below 5.0 mGy. If they would be exposed to 15 mGy of radiation at a distance of 2.5 m, what is the closest they can get to the radiation source without exceeding their maximum dose?
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<term>Half-life on radioisotopes</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		Radioactive isotopes decay in a random fashion. As they decay, the atoms in the sample change and the sample can gradually lose its radioactive properties, simply because there is less and less of the original radioactive isotope left. We measure the decay rate of radioactive isotopes using <term>half-lives.</term> One half life is the amount of time required to have the decay rate of a substance decrease by a factor of one-half. So after one half life, half of the original isotope remains and the decay rate will thus be ½ of what it originally was. After a second half life has passed, one-half of one-half of the original radioactive isotope will remain (or ¼). After each subsequent half-life the amount of original radioactive isotope will again decrease by ½. We can use this information to derive a formula to calculate the amount of radioactive isotope or the decay rate after a given amount of time has passed:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>R_{t} = R_{0} \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{t/t_{\frac{1}{2}}\ }</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this formula <m>R_{t}</m> is the decay rate or amount of isotope at time t and <m>R_{0}</m> is the original rate or amount. The variables <m>t</m> and <m>t_{\frac{1}{2}}</m> represent the time that has passed and the half-life of the isotope respectively. So if we began with 17 mCi of radioactive material that has a half-life of 8 days and 30 days have passed, we’d have <m>17 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{30}{8}} = 1.3\ </m>mCi of radioactive material left. Half lives of isotopes can vary dramatically with short ones having half-lives of seconds or minutes and long ones having half-lives of thousands of years. Isotopes that are used clinically generally have short half-lives (on the order of days or weeks) because that means that they will decay at a fast rate meaning that they can produce their useful radiation dose more quickly with less material required.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Exercise 3:</em>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>After 5 half lives, what fraction of the original radioactive material will remain?</em>
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>How about after 7 half-lives?</em>
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>After 4 half-lives what percentage of the original radioactive material will remain? Round to 3 significant figures</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>If 28.5 mg of radioactive material with a half live of 17 days is allowed to decay for 8 days, then how much will remain? Round to 3 significant figures</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>5.2 x 10<sup>7</sup> Bq of radioactive material is purchased. It has a half life of 23 hours. After exactly 7 days, how much radioactive material will remain? Round to 2 significant figures</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>A lab orders 16 mCi of radioactive material. After 8 days, 2.0 mCi remains. What is the half life of the material? Round to the nearest tenth of a day.</em>
