	</p>

	<p>
		Another way of classifying reactions is by ones that result in a transfer of electrons from one substance to another, regardless of the number of reactants or products involved. These reactions that involve a transfer of electrons are known as <term>oxidation-reduction reactions</term> (also called <term>redox reactions</term>). In a redox reaction, one or more reactants will take electrons from one or more other reactants. If a reactant gained electrons then it got <term>reduced</term>. If a reactant loses electrons, then it gets <term>oxidized.</term> This can be remembered by the saying “LeO the lion says GeR”…Losing electrons is oxidation, gaining electrons is reduction. A slight amount of confusion enters in when we talk about <term>oxidizing agents</term> and <term>reducing agents</term>. These agents are causing the oxidation or reduction of some other substance, respectively. Therefore an <term>oxidizing agent</term> will cause the oxidation of something else (ie. cause something else to lose electrons). It can only do this by accepting the electrons itself. Therefore an oxidizing agent gets reduced in a chemical reaction. The opposite is true of <term>reducing agents</term>. A reducing agent causes the reduction of another substance (ie. causes something else to gain electrons) by providing the electrons itself. Therefore reducing agents get oxidized in chemical reactions.

		When dealing with ionic compounds in a reaction, it is straightforward to determine if a redox reaction is occurring. All we need to do is look at the charge on the ion. A very important note: <em>elements have a charge of zero when in their elemental form</em>. So in <m>ZnCl_{2}</m> the zinc has a +2 charge and the chlorines each have a charge of zero. Let’s investigate the following reaction:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>ZnCl_{2}(aq) + 2Na\ (s) \rightarrow Zn\ (s) + 2NaCl\ (aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		In this case the zinc begins with a charge of +2. In the products, it is in its elemental form and thus has a charge of zero. How did the zinc change charge??? It gained two electrons! The negative charge of the two electrons cancels out the +2 charge, resulting in neutral zinc. Thus the zinc gained electrons and got reduced. In every redox reaction, something gets reduced and something gets oxidized. So in the example above, what is losing electrons? The chloride has a -1 charge in zinc chloride and still has a -1 charge in sodium chloride, so the chloride isn’t participating in the electron transfer. The sodium, on the other hand, begins in its elemental form with a charge of zero and then has a charge of +1 in the products. So the sodium is losing electrons. Each sodium loses one electron, but there are two sodium atoms present, so this adds up to 2 electrons being lost by the sodiums (which matches the two electrons being gained by the zinc; the number of electrons lost must always equal the number of electrons gained in the reaction).
	</p>

	<p>
		When <m>CH_{3}OH</m> gets turned into <m>CH_{2}O</m>, hydrogen gas (with its two electrons) is released. Therefore, the reactant <m>CH_{3}OH</m> got oxidized to <m>CH_{2}O</m>. We can recognize this because the carbon in the reactant lost a bond to hydrogen and gained a new bond to oxygen, indicating that it got oxidized. In this reaction the two hydrogen atoms that were lost from <m>CH_{3}OH</m> gained those two electrons and thus got reduced.

		One special class of redox reaction involving covalent compounds is a <term>combustion reaction</term>. In a combustion reaction, a carbon containing compound reacts with oxygen gas (<m>O_{2}</m>), producing carbon dioxide (<m>CO_{2}</m>) and water (<m>H_{2}O</m>). Combustion reactions are carried out when we burn fossil fuels in our cars or in power plants. The reaction releases a lot of energy that can be harnessed for beneficial purposes. It is also very important to note that our bodies carry out combustion reactions when we break down sugars, fats, and proteins to get harvest energy. The chemical equation showing the breakdown of glucose is shown below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + {6O}_{2} \rightarrow 6CO_{2} + {6H}_{2}O</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		It is a combustion reaction because a carbon compound reacts with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide and water. Also, the carbon atoms in the glucose compound end up losing bonds to hydrogen and gaining bonds to oxygen, indicating that they are getting oxidized. The oxygen atoms are losing a bond to the other oxygen and gaining new bonds to hydrogen and are thus getting reduced.

		<term>Balancing chemical reactions</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In chemical reactions, the <term>law of conservation of mass</term> applies. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed by chemical reactions. The consequence of this law is that when writing chemical reactions, we need to make sure that the number of each type of atom in the reaction is the same on both sides of the reaction arrow. So if there are three nitrogen atoms in the reactants, then the products side must have 3 nitrogen atoms as well. What if the numbers of atoms are not balanced? We cannot change the number of atoms in the compounds without changing the identity of that compound (ie. do NOT change the subscripts). We have to balance the reaction by adding in coefficients in front of the compounds. To do this, we’re going to follow the following steps that will work for any simple reaction (we won’t deal with more complex reaction in this class):
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Write the reaction with the correct chemical formulas of the reactants and products
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Determine the number of atoms of each element on the reactants and products sides
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						If all of the elements are balanced, then you’re done
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Select one element that appears <em><em>in only one compound</em></em> in both the reactants and the products. Balance it by adding in necessary coefficients in front of the compounds. Then check to see if the elements are balanced
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Repeat step 3 with other elements that only appear in one compound in both the reactants and product.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Balance any remaining elements by changing/adding coefficients
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Check and recheck every element for balance
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Simplify the coefficients
			</p>
		
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you have any fractional coefficients, multiply ALL of the coefficients by numbers found in the denominators
					</p>
				</li>
		
				<li>
					<p>
						If all of the coefficients have a common factor (ex. 4, 8, and 2 all have a common factor of 2), then divide them all by that common factor
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol></p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		To see these steps in practice, see the example below:
	</p>

	<p>
		Example: Balance the combustion reaction for <m>C_{2}H_{4}</m>.
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Since this is a combustion reaction, we know the other reactants (<m>O_{2}</m>) and products (<m>H_{2}O\ </m>and <m>{CO}_{2}</m>) so the reaction is <m>C_{2}H_{4} + O_{2} \rightarrow H_{2}O + CO_{2}</m>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Check to see if the atoms are balanced on both sides of the reaction:

		<term>Moles</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		In chemistry, we often have to deal with very large numbers of things (ex. atoms or molecules). For convenience, we can rely of scientific notation to help us out. We can also use the term <term>mole</term> to help us out. A mole is a word that represents a number of things (similar to how a dozen means 12 things). The number represented by a mole is <term>Avogadro’s number</term> and has a value of <m>6.022 \times 10^{23}</m>. Why this weird number? You’ll have to wait until the next section of this lesson to find out. We can use the definition of a mole as a conversion factor to convert between numbers of things (atoms/molecules/etc.) and moles:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
			<p>
		<me>\frac{1\ mole}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}\ or\frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}}{1\ mole}</me>
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		When carrying out calculations involving numbers of molecules and/or atoms, it is VERY important to add labels to our units to specify what is being quantified. This can help us see if we need to use other conversion factors in our problems. See the example below.
	</p>

	<p>
		How many molecules are in 3.0 moles of water? How many hydrogen atoms are in 3.0 moles of water?
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				We begin with 3.0 moles of water and want to determine the number of molecules of water. To do this we need to use Avogadro’s number as shown below:
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>3.0\ moles\ H_{2}O\left( \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}molecules}{1\ mole} \right) = 1.8 \times 10^{24}molecules\ H_{2}O</me>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				To convert from molecules of water to number of hydrogen atoms, we need to see that 1 water molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms. This can be written as a conversion factor and used to solve the problem as shown:
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		<me>1.8 \times 10^{24}\ molecules\ H_{2}O\ \left( \frac{2\ hydrogen\ atoms}{1\ molecule\ H_{2}O} \right) = 3.6 \times 10^{24}\ hydrogen\ atoms</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<term>Hint to try and understand moles:</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		When faced with confusing concepts in chemistry, like a mole, it can sometimes be helpful to think of more familiar examples with simpler numbers. Recall that a mole is like a dozen; it is a word that represents a number.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have 2 dozen eggs, how many do you have? 24 of course. How did you get that? You took the 2 and multiplied it by the number represented by a dozen (12).
	</p>

	<p>
		So if you have 2 moles of molecules, you’ll follow the same pattern: 2 times the number represented by a mole (6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup>).
	</p>

	<p>
		Likewise if I have 48 eggs, how many dozen do I have? 4 dozen. You get this by taking the number of objects and dividing by the number represented by a dozen.
	</p>

	<p>
		So…how would you determine how many moles of molecules you have if you have 432 molecules? Take that number and divide it by the number represented by a mole.
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>How many molecules are in 0.366 moles of carbon dioxide? How many carbon atoms? How many atoms? How many protons?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>If you have</em> <m>7.33 \times 10^{26}</m> <em>hydrogen atoms, then how many moles of atoms do you have. If those hydrogen atoms are in the form of</em> <m>H_{2}</m><em>, then how many molecules of</em> <m>H_{2}</m> <em>do you have? How many moles of H<sub>2</sub> molecules do you have?</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<em>If 3.0 moles of carbon dioxide are mixed with 4.5 moles of water, how many moles of oxygen atoms are there? How many atoms of oxygen?</em>
