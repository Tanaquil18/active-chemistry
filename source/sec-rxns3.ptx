		<term>Molar Mass and its use in chemistry</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		We’ve previously learned about atomic mass. Recall that it’s the average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotopes weighted according to their abundance. The value of the atomic mass can be found in the periodic table under the element symbol. By adding together the atomic masses of all of the elements in a compound, we can determine the <term>molecular weight</term> (for covalent compounds) or <term>formula weight</term> (for all compounds) of the compound in units of amu. Molecular weight and formula weight are calculated in the same way, but they apply to different compounds; molecular weight only applies to molecules (which only exist in covalent compounds) whereas formula weight applies to both ionic and covalent compounds. <term>Molar mass</term> is the mass of one mole of the compound. It has the same value as the formula weight and is calculated in the exact same way, but it has different units of grams per mole (g/mol) instead of amu. Thus a single carbon atom has an atomic mass of 12.011 amu, and a mole of carbon atoms will weigh 12.011 g. This is the reason for the bizarre value of Avogadro’s number…it’s the number of atoms needed to give an atom the same weight in grams as its atomic mass in atomic mass units.
	</p>

	<p>
		So we can find the molar mass of an element from the periodic table by taking the atomic mass and appending units of g/mol to it. If we can do this, then we can also figure out the molar mass of entire compounds by simply adding together the molar masses of each of the component elements.
	</p>

	<p>
		<image source='media/image1.png'/> Molar mass is used as a conversion factor to convert between grams and moles and vice-versa. When coupled with Avogadro’s number, we can convert between grams and numbers of things (like molecules). This is summed up in the diagram shown below.

		<em><term>Mole-mole relationships in chemical reactions</term></em>
	</p>

	<p>
		We just learned how to convert between moles and numbers of atoms/molecules. When we’re talking about chemical reactions, it is often very useful to be able to convert between moles of one substance in the reaction and moles of another. This allows chemists to determine how much reactant is needed for a reaction to proceed or to determine how much product can be produced. To do these calculations, we NEED to have a balanced chemical reaction. If one is not provided as a part of a question, then you need to make sure to write one.
	</p>

	<p>
		The balanced chemical reaction is key because the coefficients in front of the chemical formulas will be used to determine a conversion factor called a mole-mole ratio. For instance, the mock formula: <m>2A + B \rightarrow 3C</m> implies that for every 2 moles of A, the reaction would require one mole of B and then produce 3 moles of C. We can write these relationships as conversion factors:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{2\ moles\ A}{1\ mole\ B}\ or\frac{2\ moles\ of\ A}{3\ moles\ of\ C}\ or\frac{1\ mole\ of\ B}{3\ moles\ of\ C}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Which one we choose is determined by which information we’re given and what information we’re trying to attain. See the example and helpful hint below:
	</p>

	<p>
		For the reaction below: if we have 3.0 moles of aluminum chloride, then a) how many moles of sodium hydroxide would be needed to completely react with the aluminum chloride and b) assuming that we have an excess of sodium hydroxide, how many moles of aluminum hydroxide could be produced?
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>AlCl_{3}(aq) + 3NaOH\ (aq) \rightarrow Al(OH)_{3}(s) + 3\ NaCl\ (aq)</me>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<m>3.0\ moles\ of\ AlCl_{3}\left( \frac{3\ moles\ NaOH}{1\ mole\ AlCl_{3}} \right) = 9.0\ moles\ of\ NaOH</m>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<m>3.0\ moles\ of\ AlCl_{3}\left( \frac{1\ mole\ Al(OH)_{3}}{1\ mole\ AlCl_{3}} \right) = 3.0\ moles\ Al(OH)_{3}</m>
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol></p>

	<p>
		Helpful hint:
	</p>

	<p>
		It can be helpful to think of more obvious examples of ‘reactions’ that we are familiar with in our everyday lives. The problem solving strategies that you employ can be similarly used in chemistry problem solving. For instance, we all know that a tricycle has 3 wheels. If I have 6 wheels, how many tricycles can I make? The answer is hopefully easy for you to determine…we can make 2 tricycles with 6 wheels. How did you solve this and could you instead use dimensional analysis and a balanced reaction to solve it?
	</p>

	<p>
		Balanced reaction: <m>1\ tricycle\ frame + 3\ wheels \rightarrow 1\ tricycle</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Conversion factor: <m>\frac{1\ tricycle}{3\ wheels}</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Math with the conversion factor: <m>6\ wheels\ \left( \frac{1\ tricycle}{3\ wheels} \right) = 2\ tricycles</m>

		<em><term>Theoretical yield in chemical reactions</term></em>
	</p>

	<p>
		In a chemical reaction, it is often surprising to students that the mass of the reactants does not match up with the mass of the products. The <term>law of conservation of mass</term> states that the total mass of all of the reactants must equal the mass of all of the products, but the masses of individual reactants or products often differ. For instance, in the reaction <m>2H_{2}\ (g) + O_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2H_{2}O</m> if we start with 2 grams of hydrogen gas (and excess oxygen gas), we don’t get a mass of 2 grams of water; we get about 18 grams of water! Don’t the coefficients from the balanced reaction mean that for every 2 grams of hydrogen gas, we should get 2 grams of water?! No. The coefficients only apply when we’re counting things (numbers of molecules or moles of molecules); they do NOT apply to mass. Why not? The reason is that different molecules have different masses. We can illustrate this with a relatable example:
	</p>

	<p>
		For the reaction, <m>4\ tires + 1\ car\ frame \rightarrow 1\ car</m>, if each tire weighs 40 pounds, would you expect the car to weigh only 160 pounds? No. The reason is that the car frame adds mass. The car will have the mass of those tires, but also extra mass from the frame. Similarly, water has added mass from oxygen and thus the 2 grams of hydrogen gas end up producing a larger mass of water.
	</p>

	<p>
		<image source='media/image2.png'/> The previous section allows us to determine the number of moles of product that can be produced in a chemical reaction if we are given the number of moles of reactants. In a laboratory setting, we don’t have any tool that allows us to measure the number of moles of a reactant directly. Instead, we are able to determine the amount of reactants and products by measuring their mass. As we learned in the last lesson, we can easily convert between grams and moles using the molar mass of a substance. So if we are given a certain number of grams of reactant, we can determine the number of moles of that reactant. We can then convert that number of moles to moles of product using the balanced chemical reaction and the mole-mole conversion factor. Finally, we can convert between the number of moles of product and the number of grams of product by using the molar mass of that product. This procedure is summarized in the diagram below:
