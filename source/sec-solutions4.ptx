		<term>Molarity in reactions</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		We can do chemical reactions using reactants that are dissolved in solution. We’ve learned one example of this previously when we learned about precipitation reactions. In our next chapter, we will learn about acid-base reactions which often take place in solution as well. Because of this, it is important to be able to carry out calculations involving these reactions. Solution reactions are particularly important because of <term>titrations</term>, chemical reactions that are carried out to measure the amount (or concentration) of a molecule or ion in a solution. Titrations are very useful in chemistry, allowing chemists to measure the quantities such as the amount of pollutants in drinking water.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thankfully, carrying out these sorts of calculations proceeds in a similar way as other reaction calculations that we’ve done previously. The difference is in the start point and end point. Instead of starting off with a mass of reactant, we will start off with a molarity and volume. We can use this information to calculate the number of moles of the reactant using dimensional analysis or the formula below:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>Molarity \times Liters = moles</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		<image source='media/image1.png'/>Once we know the number of moles of reactant, we can change this to moles of another reactant or moles of product by using a mole-mole conversion factor derived from the balanced chemical equation. From there, the number of moles of that substance can be converted to mass using the molar mass or to molarity using the volume. See the figure and example below.
	</p>

	<p>
		Example. If 23.5mL of 0.988 M NaOH is needed to neutralize (fully react with) 7.50 mL of HCl, then what is the molarity of that HCl solution?

	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{0.988\ moles}{L} \times 0.0235L = 0.023218\ moles\ NaOH</me>
	</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				We need to convert from moles of NaOH to moles of HCl using a mole-mole conversion factor

	<p>
		<me>0.023218\ moles\ NaOH\ \left( \frac{1\ mole\ HCl}{1\ mole\ NaOH} \right) = 0.023218\ moles\ HCl</me>
	</p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Molarity=moles/Liters. We need to first change our volume to L, then use the equation.

	<p>
		<me>7.50\ mL\ \left( \frac{10^{- 3}\ L}{1\ mL} \right) = 0.00750\ L</me>
	</p>

		<me>\frac{0.023218\ moles}{0.00750\ L} = 3.0957\ M \rightarrow 3.10\ M</me>

		<term>Osmosis and dialysis</term>
	</p>

	<p>
		If two solutions (or one solution and a pure solvent) are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then dialysis and osmosis can occur. What is a semi-permeable membrane? It is a membrane that has very tiny holes in it that of a certain size. This allows very small molecules and ions to travel across the membrane (ex. water, small covalent molecules like glucose, and soluble salts can cross the membrane) while larger molecules and objects can’t (ex. proteins and blood cells cannot cross because they can’t fit through the tiny holes). <term>Diffusion</term> is a term that describes the movement of molecules in a solution. <em>In diffusion, molecules generally move from an area with a high concentration to an area with low concentration.</em> <term>Dialysis</term> is a term that describes the diffusion of solute molecules across a semipermeable membrane from the side with a high concentration to an area with a low concentration. <term>Osmosis</term> describes the movement of water (the solvent) across the semi-permeable membrane, and will be discussed in a little bit.
	</p>

	<p>
		As stated above, solute will move via diffusion from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This will continue until the concentrations are the same on both sides of the membrane. So if two solutions, one containing 1.0 M NaCl and the other containing 0.50 M NaCl are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then the NaCl will move from the side with 1.0M NaCl towards the side with 0.50M NaCl. <em>If both sides have the same volume</em>, then this will continue until the concentration on both sides is the average of the two starting concentrations, 0.75M NaCl (IMPORTANT NOTE: this is only the case if the volumes are the same on both sides of the membrane. In this class, we will not do the more complex calculations where the volumes are different on both sides of the membrane).
	</p>

	<p>
		Osmosis is similar to dialysis, but it describes the movement of the solvent (water) instead of the solute. Similar to dialysis, osmosis is governed by diffusion and water will move from an area with a high concentration <em><em>of water</em></em> to a low concentration <em><em>of water.</em></em> Why am I emphasizing that the movement depends on the concentration of water? This is because concentrations usually focus on the concentration of the solute, rather than the solvent. How are we supposed to figure out the concentration of the water then? We can qualitatively determine the relative concentration by keeping in mind this rule: the concentration of solute and the concentration of solvent are inversely proportional…meaning that if the concentration of solute is high, then the concentration of solvent is low. Why is this? It’s because if there is a lot of solute, then it is taking up space in the solution that would otherwise have been occupied by solvent…thus there is less solvent in the same amount of space.
	</p>

	<p>
		In osmosis, water will flow from the side with a low solute concentration to the side with a high solute concentration, because that is the same as saying that the water is flowing from the side with a high water concentration to the side with a low water concentration. So if two solutions, one containing 1.0 M NaCl and the other containing 0.50 M NaCl are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then the water will move from the side with 0.5 M NaCl towards the side with 1.0M NaCl, the opposite direction of the solute movement. The water pressing up against the membrane as it tries to cross applies a force to the membrane called <term>osmotic pressure</term>. In extreme cases, this pressure can be so strong that it causes the semi-permeable membrane to break.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our body’s cells are surrounded by a semi-permeable cell membrane. Thus dialysis and osmosis are important considerations in medicine. This is particularly true when administering fluids directly into the bloodstream (ex. IV fluids). Doctors and nurses need to make sure that the osmotic pressure of the fluid being administered balances the osmotic pressure inside of the patient’s cells. Solutions where the osmotic pressure is balanced with the pressure inside of a cell are called <term>isotonic solutions.</term> Two common isotonic solutions used in medicine are 0.9% m/v sodium chloride and 5% w/v glucose. Solutions that contain too little solute (and thus a higher than normal concentration of water) are called <term>hypotonic solutions</term>. These solutions will cause water to rush into cells, causing them to swell and, in severe cases, to burst. If the concentration of solute is higher than normal, then the solution is a <term>hypertonic solution.</term> If a hypertonic solution is administered, water will move out of blood cells, causing them to shrink and wrinkle in appearance, a phenomenon called crenation.
	</p>

	<p>
		In medicine, blood dialysis is used when a patient has non-functional kidneys. Our kidneys normally filter toxins from our blood stream and help to maintain ion and water balance. When the kidneys don’t work, then the blood must be filtered artificially. In blood dialysis, the patient’s blood is removed from their body and passed over a semi-permeable membrane. On the other side of the membrane is an isotonic solution that is free from the toxins that are found in blood. The semipermeable membrane prevents large proteins and blood cells from leaving the blood. The toxins in the blood, however, can cross the membrane and flow from the area with high concentration (the blood) to the area with low concentration (the dialysis fluid on the other side of the membrane), thus eliminating them from the patient’s body.
